<time>15 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> is one of the biggest names in modern history, and her time in music has been amazing to watch unfold. She has sold millions of albums, has feuded with names like Kanye West, and has collaborated with musicians like Brendon Urie. The singer has also been in many high profile relationships and <a href=#>recently split from long-term boyfriend Joe Alwyn</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift had a unique journey to reach the top, and one thing people have grown curious about is how she learned to play guitar. Turns out, this story has two very different sides to it. Let's hear what each party had to say about this pivotal moment.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-is-a-modern-icon>Taylor Swift Is A Modern Icon</h2><p>In the modern landscape of the music business, few stars are as popular and as genuinely talented as Taylor Swift. The artist was able to make a name for herself while she was still just a teenager, and once she tasted global success, she would build a legacy that will continue to endure for decades.</p><p>Swift's songwriting abilities were evident at a young age, and regardless of the genre that she is tapping into, she simply has a knack for making a catchy song that millions of fans will fall in love with.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taylor-swift.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During her career, she has sold over 100 million records, and she has topped the charts on numerous occasions. At this point, she is as big as ever, and she shows no signs of slowing down.</p><p>Now, Swift is busy with her Era Tour, during which she is performing music from her entire repertoire. <a href=#>The singer is also re-recording her own music</a> in order to own the rights due to the dispute with Scott Braun.</p><p>Of course, it all had to start somewhere, and Taylor Swift has had herself one heck of a journey to the top.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Some Taylor Swift Lyrics Aren't As Subliminal As Fans Might Have Suspected</a></span></p><h2 id=how-did-taylor-swift-become-famous>How Did Taylor Swift Become Famous?</h2><p>One of the unique things about Taylor Swift's rise is that she came from seemingly out of nowhere to make a name for herself in country music. Swift is a massive crossover star these days, but the early days of her career saw her conquering country music before adding in pop and other elements into the equation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amazingly, he parents were willing to move mountains for her, even when she was just a kid who was figuring things out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/untitled-design-1.png><p>"The parents already had her MySpace and her website up and running. The mom and dad both have great marketing minds. I donâ€™t want to say fake it until you make it, but when you looked at her stuff, it was very professional even before she got her deal," her former manager revealed.</p><p>Incredibly, her father even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">relocated out to Nashville</a> to give his daughter the best chance at success. Things worked out perfectly, as fans got to see, but there's more to the story. A major piece of the puzzle was young Taylor learning how to play guitar, and that story changes a bit, depending on who you ask.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Taylor Swift And These Celebrities Wrote Hit Songs And Absolute Bangers In Under 30 Minutes</a></span></p><h2 id=how-did-taylor-swift-learn-to-play-guitar>How Did Taylor Swift Learn To Play Guitar?</h2><p>Swift revealed this story years back, saying, "When I was about 12 this magical twist of fate (happened). I was doing my homework [when the tech fixing my computer] looked over and saw the guitar in the corner. And he said, 'Do you play guitar?' I said, 'Oh. No. I tried, but ....' He said 'Do you want me to teach you a few chords?' and I said, 'Uh, yeah. YES!'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/taylor-swift-at-the-mtv-europe-music-awards-2022.jpg><p>That man was none other than Ronnie Cremer, who unknowingly had a hand in changing the music industry by teaching Swift how to strum a guitar at a young age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cremer gave <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his account of things</a>, adding some more depth to what Swift had already revealed.</p><p>"I only met Taylor face-to-face in 2002. I had a shop up in Leesport. It was a computer shop, and that's where I had my little studio. My brother brought Taylor and her mom and her brother over and introduced me, and said, 'would you be interested in recording a demo?' It was a couple cover songs. I recorded the demo for her. It wasn't a great demo, but it was a demo," he said.</p><p>"After I did the demo, I was approached again by my brother, and by Andrea Swift. 'Would I be interested in giving guitar lessons for Taylor? We're trying to teach her how to play country music.' I said, 'I don't know if I can teach country music. I don't know the first thing about country music. I know rock music,'" he continued.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Said "Anti-Hero" Is About Her Insecurities, But Fans Believe The True Meaning Of The Song Is Far Juicier</a></span></p><p>Eventually, Ronnie Cremer taught Swift how to play guitar, and the rest, as they say, is history. The story Swift told wasn't exactly how it happened in Ronnie's eyes, but as Ronnie Kremer noted, "It's just that their publicity team, that doesn't sell as good: A 36-year-old bald guy taught her. That ain't gonna work."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1ll6q2ta3RZqOinV2lv27AxJqkZqqfo7uqsYycqZ6llad8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-guitar-lie-pr-team-ronnie-cremer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftaylor-swift-guitar-lie-pr-team-ronnie-cremer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-guitar-lie-pr-team-ronnie-cremer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftaylor-swift-guitar-lie-pr-team-ronnie-cremer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-guitar-lie-pr-team-ronnie-cremer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-guitar-lie-pr-team-ronnie-cremer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./evangeline-lilly-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./evangeline-lilly-net-worth.html>Evangeline Lilly Net Worth: Lifestyle &amp;amp; Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./688920-chrisean-rock-blueface-tattoo-removal-live-stream.html>Chrisean Rock Says She's Considered Removing Blueface Tattoos But Doesn't Believe She Ever Will</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./688920-chrisean-rock-blueface-tattoo-removal-live-stream.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
