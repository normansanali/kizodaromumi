Years earlier, he streamlined the use of mugshots, effectively revolutionizing detective work all with a camera.</h2><i class="fa fa-times"></i> <span class=caption-body>Monsieur Falla, murdered in his sleep, in the corridor of his apartment at 160 Rue du Temple in Paris, 1905.</span><span class=credit>Public Domain</span> <span class=caption-body>When Alphonse Bertillon joined the Prefecture of Police in Paris in 1879, the department had already collected 80,000 photographs of known criminals. They were captured under variable lighting, and at most, only accompanied by a name and address.</span><span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=caption-body>Bertillon, who was a mere entry-level clerk at the time, began to devise a more efficient manner of cataloguing criminal records. He would measure 11 unique traits of as many convicted criminals as possible, and note these next to their mugshots — one photo of their face head-on, and another from from the side.</span><span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=caption-body>Among the traits Bertillon recorded was arm length, head length, and the distance between fingertips with arms outstretched.</span><span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=caption-body>Known also as the anthropometric system, criminal records also kept track of a suspect's height, ear size, foot size, arm length, eye color, skin tone, and any notable marks.</span><span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=caption-body>Within a few years, Bertillon's eponymous system allowed officers to scan their records by any category they desired — from foot size and hair color to birth marks and skin tone. It was a much more efficient system than the previous model, which forced police to rifle through stacks of photos with lacking details.</span><span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=caption-body>Bertillon was also the first to take crime scene photos. He believed the evidence captured on film could serve officers during ongoing investigations. Taking photos also stopped officers from contaminating the scene.</span><span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=caption-body>Many of Bertillon's peers scoffed at the notion that photography would, in any way, help reduce the crime rate.</span><span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=caption-body>But by 1883, Bertillon had collected 7,336 measurements and identified 49 repeat offenders. That figure reached 241 by the following year.</span><span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=caption-body>It was a much more efficient system than the previous model, which forced police to rifle through stacks of photos with lacking details.</span><span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=caption-body>Often heralded as the first forensic expert for his innovations, Alphonse Bertillon was also one of the first known people to identify a criminal by a fingerprint collected at a crime scene. </span><span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=caption-body>But his path to detective reform wasn't always clear. As a youth, Bertillon had failed out of school twice — to the chagrin of his statistician father and brother. </span><span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=caption-body>After successfully enlisting in the French army at 26 years of age, Bertillon served one tour — as a bugle player.</span><span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=caption-body>Bertillon's father eventually got him work at the Paris police department.</span><span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=caption-body>But Alphonse Bertillon's innovative system was not without its flaws. While he was correct in positing that each human being is unique, and thus a roster of unique traits could more effectively identify a suspect, the Bertillon System failed when it came to documenting children.</span><span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=caption-body>The measurements of underage criminals, such as head circumference or height, were constantly changing. It was thus incredibly difficult to document a child and then identify them later when their measurements had all matured and changed.</span><span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=caption-body>This is the bedroom of Madame Debeinche, a Parisian woman who was murdered on May 5, 1903.<p>Her chambers remain one of the earliest photographed crime scenes in history, and Debeinche herself one of the earliest murder victims ever photographed.</p></span><span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=caption-body>Sherlock Holmes author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote in The Hound of Baskervilles that Holmes was "the second highest expert in Europe" — after Alphonse Bertillon.</span><span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=caption-body>Bertillon preferred to take low-angle photographs like this one, as well as bird's-eye views of his victims.</span><span class=credit>Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> <span class=caption-body>He also used compounds to preserve crime scene details like footprints.

That is until a French police officer named <a href=# rel=noopener>Alphonse Bertillon</a> found an innovative solution.</p><p>Bertillon proffered an eponymous system in which arresting officers measured and described 11 unique physical traits of each suspect, which was to then be filed away with a photograph of their faces.</p><p>The profile was so successful at keeping tabs on repeat offenders that the Paris Police adopted it as common practice in 1883. And by 1893, Alphonse Bertillon had <a href=# rel=noopener>standardized</a> the use of what's now known as the modern mugshot across Europe.</p><p>But his innovations didn't end there. Bertillon was also the first to document crime scenes through photography. He would frame victims alongside their surrounding objects to properly record scale and dimension before investigators tainted the site.</p><p>Take a look at how exactly Alphonse Bertillon revolutionized detective work through these 33 vintage mugshots and crime scene photos.</p><h2>The Invention Of The Bertillon System</h2><p>Born on April 22, 1853, in Paris, France, Alphonse Bertillon was raised to appreciate data. Though he was the son of a statistician, Bertillon failed out of school, much to his father's disappointment.</p><p>Searching for a career path, Bertillon joined the army as a bugle player at age 26, but his father found him more respectable employment as an entry-level clerk at the Paris Police Station.</p><p>Bertillon was tasked with painstakingly rifling through the cellar and copying prisoner admission forms by hand. During this work, he noted stark variations in witness descriptions, which made it difficult for officers to identify and arrest criminals.</p><p>Additionally, he realized that even though the Paris police <a href=# rel=noopener>had been using</a> photography to keep track of criminals, the images were all captured in inconsistent lighting and were organized only by name and address. Bertillon realized this had allowed repeat offenders to be misidentified as first-time crooks for years.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-327889 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/alphonse-bertillon-mug-shot.jpeg alt="Alphonse Bertillon Mug Shot" width=900 height=551 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-327889 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Alphonse Bertillon showcasing his mugshot method on himself.</span></p><p>Alphonse Bertillon thus devised a method to more accurately identify and organize suspects known as forensic anthropometry.</p><p>He knew that every human was unique, but this was before the advent of DNA tests, however, so the most effective way to identify someone was through physical measurements. Thus, Bertillon took careful note of 11 unique traits on each criminal.</p><p>Soon enough, Paris police were able to sort through their collections of known criminals with ease. From skin tone and hair color to finger length and head circumference, forensic anthropometry was a far better system than rifling through stacks of photos — although these had to be refined, as well.</p><p>Alphonse Bertillon did so by standardizing the mugshot and taking photographs of the full face and profile view in uniform lighting. By 1883, Bertillon had <a href=# rel=noopener>taken</a> 7,336 measurements and identified 49 repeat offenders. By 1884, his system caught 241 repeat offenders.</p><h2>The Invention Of Crime Scene Photography</h2><p>While efficiently codifying criminal records to the great advantage of the law, Bertillon realized that studying the crime scenes themselves could prove worthwhile in finding serial criminals.</p><p>He thus documented crime scenes using a process called "metric photography." This not only kept a visual record of the scenes for later review but also provided investigators with the scales and dimensions of blood spatter or the distances between the victim and nearby objects. Detectives could also work on cases remotely or through time with these photographs.</p><p>Bertillon also thought to record the state of a corpse. He was the first to <a href=# rel=noopener>set</a> his tripod up and capture a crime scene from above, documenting the whole room with the corpse in full view. He also took close-ups of the victims.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-327887 alt="Alphonse Bertillon At World Exhibition" width=900 height=516 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/alphonse-bertillon-crime-scene-photos-exhibition.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-327887 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>New York University</span><span class=caption-body>Bertillon at Chicago's 1893 World's Columbian Exposition exhibit of his work.</span></p><p>Naturally, Alphonse Bertillon's crime scene photos and mugshots immortalized him in criminal justice history, and he became one of the first forensic investigators to identify a criminal from fingerprints left at the scene in 1902.</p><p>But Bertillon was hesitant to accept other innovations in detective work. He had a particular disdain for handwriting analysis, which led to the largest blemish in his career.</p><p>Despite having no experience in the matter, he accepted the call to testify in the trials of Captain Alfred Dreyfus in 1894 and 1899. Dreyfus was charged with espionage but denied penning the incriminating document in question. In a bizarre testimony, Bertillon claimed Dreyfus did write the document, leading to the defendant's life sentence.</p><p>Dreyfus was exonerated in 1906, which somewhat marred Alphonse Bertillon's legacy until his death in 1914.</p><p>But despite those scandals, Alphonse Bertillon is nonetheless considered one of the fathers of forensic photography and the very first forensic expert in history.</p><p>After looking at these macabre crime scene images taken by Alphonse Bertillon, take a look at <a href=#>28 serial killer crime scene photos from famous murders</a>.
