As a member of the WGA, SAG-AFTRA and the DGA, <a href=#>Craig was behind the writers</a>, and was among those in Hollywood push the studios towards a deal.</p><p>He said with Deadline, “I support the strike wholeheartedly."</p><p>"You have one job as a producer and that’s to make a deal. That’s really the whole ethos of being a producer and they’re not making a deal, and I can’t understand that. Any good producer finds a way to make a deal that everyone walks away feeling kind of good about so I can’t imagine why an association of producers can’t get together with a bunch of people who want to work and say, ‘All right, we have to find a deal’.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ferguson continued on mentioning that the strike felt different compared to his days on TV when another strike emerged during the 2007/2008 campaign.</p><p>“If I think back, it was not about a seismic change in the industry. It was about unfairness. Strikes are always about unfairness, but I think that this one is about a real change. There’s a real shift, it’s like sound coming to the movies. It’s a big deal,” he said.</p><p>As for Ferguson keeping up with late night TV since his departure, the former host revealed he hasn't kept up but in fairness, he didn't keep up when he was in the spotlight either.</p><p>“I’ll be honest with you, I didn’t watch late night before I was doing it. I certainly didn’t watch it when I was doing it. and I don’t watch it now. It’s a weird thing, it’s kind of like snooker to me. I never watched snooker on TV. I’m happy to play it, but I’m not going to watch it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fair enough, Craig!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq%2FRmqCgZZaav6jB0qilZmpgZ4Bw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-craig-ferguson-2023.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-craig-ferguson-2023.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-craig-ferguson-2023.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-craig-ferguson-2023.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-craig-ferguson-2023.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-craig-ferguson-2023.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-yellow-dresses-for-women.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-yellow-dresses-for-women.html>10 best yellow dresses for summer (and yes, Meghan Markle has inspired us)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-iphone-se-2020-quick-review-reinvigorated-classic.html>Video Recording - The iPhone SE (2020) Review: A Reinvigorated Classic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-iphone-se-2020-quick-review-reinvigorated-classic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
