John later got an opportunity when he was only 7 years old to audition for the character of Kevin in the hilarious Home Alone film. His parents were however sceptical and declined.</p><p>Mulaney, therefore had a more traditional upbringing going to St. Clement School for junior high. Still, the budding comedian found a way to make school work for him. In place of reports, he would get together with his best friend named John O’Brien, and the two would perform skits about what they had learned in school. He was also a frequent visitor to the Museum of Broadcast Communications which allowed him to watch archived episodes of the shows he loved.</p><p>The would-be comedian graduated from St. Ignatius Colleg Prep in the year 2000 and then went to the university his parents had attended – Georgetown University – to study English Literature and Religion. At Georgetown, he joined an improv group, which had Nick Kroll and Mike Birbiglia as members, and after they had connected in the group, he would later join Birbiglia to do stand-up tours that helped him get better on his stagecraft.</p><p>Following his graduation, John Mulaney moved to New York and got hired as a Comedy Central office assistant. He stayed on for a year before pitching the idea for I Love the ’30s as a parody of the I Love the ’80s. He developed the show with his old friend from improv Nick Kroll. Soon Mulaney landed a gig on Saturday Night Live, began contributing to other projects on TV like Documentary Now!, and the Comedy Central Roast of James Franco. John Mulaney soon ventured into acting showing up in a supporting actor capacity in such shows as Difficult People and Crashing.</p><p>In 2018, John Mulaney does voice work for the lead character on the Netflix animated series Big Mouth which Nick Kroll co-created. It was also announced in the same year that he would voice the character of Spider-Ham in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse animated film.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-john-mulaneys-wife-%e2%80%93-annamarie-tendler></span><strong>Who is John Mulaney’s Wife – Annamarie Tendler?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>John Mulaney is married to Annamarie Tendler.
