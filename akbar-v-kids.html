She has not even mentioned who their daddies are.</p><p>Moreover, Akbar has no parental rights to their kids as she has given five of her kids for adoption.

It is a surgical weight loss procedure that shrinks your belly size and ultimately reduces your appetite. After losing appetite, she eventually shed many pounds on her body. After quite some time, she again went through a second cosmetic surgery with plastic surgeon Dr. Curves. He updated her fans about her surgery through her Instagram posts.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-7019 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritygen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Akbar-V-weight-loss.jpg alt="Akbar V surgical weight loss" width=799 height=544 sizes="(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-7019 class=wp-caption-text>An American rapper, Akbar V</p><h2>Akbar V Net Worth</h2><p>From what you have read about her in this article till now, you must be curious regarding her wealth.
