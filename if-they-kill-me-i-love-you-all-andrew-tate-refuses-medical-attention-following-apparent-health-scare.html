<time>11 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p data-characters=242 data-injectable=true data-video=true>Earlier today, in a series of now-deleted tweets, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Tate</a></strong> shared photos and videos of himself while suggesting he was poisoned, adding that he was refusing to see doctors for his condition out of fear that they would try to kill him, too.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=468 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>Tate has repeatedly alleged that people are out to get him, and even claims his recent detainment as proof. Tate was detained by Romanian authorities in December as part of a criminal investigation related to human trafficking. However, he was released into house arrest last month, as investigators have thus far failed to indict on specific charges, a change in detention status which has prompted some of Tate’s followers to believe further in everything he says.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false><br>While sharing his apparent health scare today, the massively popular social media influencer retweeted one of his posts from December which simply reads,”If they kill me, I love you all.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>If they kill me I love you all.</p>— Andrew Tate (@Cobratate) <a href=#>December 14, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>Originally, as shown on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LADBible</a>, Tate tweeted a photo of himself along with a video that shows his skin has turned a shade of red which appears to be an allergic reaction but, when someone else began tweeting for Andrew on his account, it was explained that “Andrew is not allergic to anything. This has never happened before.”</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>It’s worth noting that someone can have allergic reactions for the first time as an adult, and it wouldn’t necessarily be something they were aware of nor experienced before.</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=138 data-injectable=false>It was suggested, through the person tweeting for Andrew, “Either an insect bite or some matrix attack insanity in his bottled water.”</p><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>Apparently, as per the tweet, Tate is refusing to see a doctor about his present condition, because he is convinced that the doctor will inject him with something meant to try and kill him.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true>Shortly thereafter, the tweets were deleted, making one wonder if his condition got worse or if it got better. Either way, he followed it up by tweeting, “If I tell you the truth, they would put me in jail.” Then he stated that’s why he had to delete it.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/26C53411-829C-486D-A74C-7F79C797B3E6.jpeg><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true>ln an ironic twist, he then deleted the tweet explaining why he deleted the other tweets. He has not, however, given any further updates on his immediate health.</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>Tate spent his morning calling British actor Adam Hussain “a pu**y” because Hussein publicly apologized for liking Tate’s tweets. The Coronation Street actor claims he liked them by mistake. Andrew is often accused of expressing misogynistic views and, coupled with his legal problems which includes new <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">allegations of raping women</a>, he is therefore not the least controversial figure one can follow.<br></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I teach men to become filthy rich.</p><p>You can be an actor – but they still have you by the balls.</p><p>He agrees with me, but backtracks like ickle pussybowy or he gets FIRED.</p><p>Money is ULTRA important to escape the slave mind.</p><p>Learn what you need to escape: <a href=#>https://t.co/iL1xdutuQB</a></p>— Andrew Tate (@Cobratate) <a href=#>April 27, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>He also suggested that Hussain is being controlled by people who can easily cost him his job, though his wording is slightly more assertive.<br></p><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=104 data-injectable=false>After deleting his health-related tweets, Tate tweeted a poster of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steven Seagal</a> movie Hard to Kill.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=104 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8qrKMrZ%2BesV2gtq24jKacZqFdoby3sYyypq5lkaG5bq3Nnamer12prrWxjKucn62jmsBuucSdoJyZnGKutcDEp6uip55is7C4y6iuoqaXYq6xvMCrnKesXZ2yorjToWSsm5GnsnA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fif-they-kill-me-i-love-you-all-andrew-tate-refuses-medical-attention-following-apparent-health-scare.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fif-they-kill-me-i-love-you-all-andrew-tate-refuses-medical-attention-following-apparent-health-scare.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fif-they-kill-me-i-love-you-all-andrew-tate-refuses-medical-attention-following-apparent-health-scare.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fif-they-kill-me-i-love-you-all-andrew-tate-refuses-medical-attention-following-apparent-health-scare.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fif-they-kill-me-i-love-you-all-andrew-tate-refuses-medical-attention-following-apparent-health-scare.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fif-they-kill-me-i-love-you-all-andrew-tate-refuses-medical-attention-following-apparent-health-scare.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jesus-ortiz-paz-girlfriend-jailyne-ojeda-age-difference-height-net-worth-find-her-on-instagram.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jesus-ortiz-paz-girlfriend-jailyne-ojeda-age-difference-height-net-worth-find-her-on-instagram.html>Jesus Ortiz Paz Girlfriend Jailyne Ojeda Age Difference, Height Net Worth, Find Her On Instagram</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./chase-pre-qualify.html>How to Prequalify for a Chase Credit Card in 2022?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./chase-pre-qualify.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
