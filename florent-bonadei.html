On the other hand, Florent’s birth date was well-known. He celebrated his birthday annually on August 21st.</p><p>Florent was born on August 21st, under the zodiac sign of Leo.</p><h2><span id=Florent_Ethnic_origin_education_and_familial_status>Florent Ethnic origin, education, and familial status</span></h2><p>To be sure, there was no information on the web about Florent’s family. Indeed, the only time we discovered a reference to Florent’s family was in an Instagram post in which Florent shared a photo of Piece Montee that his family had created for his birthday.</p><p>While Florent Bonadei appears on a reality show about Asian and Asian-American people, he is actually white and not even an American. Florent is of European ancestry. He is, in fact, a Parisian.</p><p>When it came to his education, Florent was quite the cultured gentleman. He completed his undergraduate studies at Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole. He later earned a master’s degree from the European School of Economics and a management license from the Universite Paris Nanterre.</p><p>He also held a Cambridge English First Certificate from the University of Cambridge.</p><h2><span id=Height_and_Weight>Height and Weight</span></h2><p>Florent Bonadei, according to numerous reports, is a man of <strong>average height, standing at 5 ft 11 inches.</strong> And he <strong>weighed approximately 79 kilograms.</strong></p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Instagram_Facebook_and_Twitter><span class="TextRun SCXW89176628 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW89176628 BCX8" data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2">Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW89176628 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559738":40,"335559739":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Florent had a sizable social media presence, but not nearly enough reach. He had 427 Instagram posts (as of 18 January 2021) but only 5.5k followers.</p><p>He had only 60 followers on Twitter. He also had a Facebook profile, but it was almost entirely comprised of a cover photo.</p><h2><span id=Florent_Bonadei_Career_and_Glamour_Empire>Florent Bonadei Career, and Glamour Empire</span></h2><p>Florent works professionally in the fashion industry as a manager and executive. He began his professional career as a demonstrator for DSQAURED2 SPA. And later worked for renowned French fashion designer Catherine Malandrino, menswear label Berluti, and luxury fashion house Maison Martin Margiela.</p><p>Florent worked for Valentino the fashion brand from 2014 to 2017, first as an assistant manager and then as director. He was employed by Boucheron, a French luxury jewelry house, as of January 2021.</p><p>For the last ten months, he worked at Boucheron as an EMEA & North America Business Developer & Private Client Development Manager. He had previously worked in the same company as a private client executive.</p><p>Apart from his professional duties, Florent had appeared on Netflix’s new reality show Bling Empire, which follows wealthy Asians in Los Angeles. Florent appeared as Anna Shay’s best friend, one of the show’s lead cast members and matriarch.</p><p>Florent’s and Anna’s Instagram feeds are both clogged with each other’s images. They appear to be very close to one another. Indeed, Anna frequently approached him for assistance. For instance, he educated Anna on Influencer culture, specifically on sponsorship.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_worth_of_Florent_Bonadei><span class="TextRun SCXW217307087 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW217307087 BCX8">What is the Net worth of Florent Bonadei?</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW217307087 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p><strong>Florent Bonadei’s net worth was estimated to be around half a million dollars (i.e. $500 thousand) as of early 2021.</strong></p><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Florent Bonadei estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

Florent was asked for his number near the end of the first season of the Bling Empire by Kane Lim, a friend of his best friend, Anna.</p><p>Florent appeared to respond positively, stating that he was single and extremely available. That clarified Florent’s sexuality: he was gay.</p><p>What happened next is unknown. Florent’s and Kane’s Instagrams were devoid of any indications that the two were dating. They did, however, follow each other on Instagram. However, there was still no conclusive evidence that Kane had become Florent’s romantic partner.</p><p>Additionally, there was no information regarding Florent’s previous partners prior to Kane.
