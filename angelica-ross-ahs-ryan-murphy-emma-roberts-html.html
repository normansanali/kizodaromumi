In a series of posts on X (née Twitter) on September 18, Ross <a href=#>shared screenshots of email conversations</a> she had with Pose and AHS creator Ryan Murphy, accompanied by quotes from <a href=#>Zakiya Dalila Harris’s&nbsp;The Other Black Girl</a>, claiming that he ghosted her after saying he wanted to work with her on a season of AHS, causing her to miss other opportunities, like a Marvel role. Then, on September 22, the Hollywood Reporter published an interview with Ross, detailing interactions with both Murphy and Emma Roberts, her American Horror Story co-star. Below, unpack the alleged real-life horror story.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmuy4pt4000e3b7hmfgqhlhq@published>Where does the Angelica Ross/Ryan Murphy drama begin?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmuy4ea3000b3b7hts7wnpc4@published data-word-count=135>Chronologically, the drama starts back on the set of Pose. “There would be so much chaos going on because on a Ryan Murphy set, there is sure to be chaos,” Ross told THR. “That’s just something that people know from&nbsp;Glee. We’ve heard about that on&nbsp;American Horror Story,&nbsp;Scream Queens,&nbsp;and so on.” Ross was famously written off of Pose <a href=#>with her character Candy’s death</a> in season three and written onto AHS, apparently so Murphy could, “Paint a narrative that he is supportive,” Ross says. However, when she heard what her potential salary would be for AHS ($28,000 an episode) she turned the opportunity down and asked for $50,000. Eventually, they did bump up her offer. “It wasn’t $50,000 an episode, but it was a significant bump,” Ross says. “And then I went on to do those seasons.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmv1lzst000b3b6w94rp9cad@published>What happened on AHS?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmv39wlj000d3b7jvi180o51@published data-word-count=243>Filming AHS: 1984, Ross once had to leave set when a driver operating the car Ross drove on camera was “wearing a racist T-shirt” every day, with phrases including “BUILD THAT WALL” or “I DON’T KNEEL.” “I’m seeing this man with these shirts, and I’m trying to focus, and when they say action, I just said, “It’s cut. I can’t do this anymore,” Ross said. She then stopped filming and got into a production van saying, “I’m not coming out of this van until you handle the situation.” After director John J. Gray told her that he could not remedy the issue, Ross tweeted, “It’s a shame that I do all this work out in the world on anti-Blackness and racism and have to come to a set and do the same work.” Soon after, in Ross’s telling, she was called by producer Tanase Popa who said, “Ryan Murphy thinks you should take that tweet down. Things are being handled, and he considers us a family, and we don’t share things outside the family.” Though the driver was still on the set, per Ross, she says Popa said, “I hear you. It’s just that these situations are difficult.” “Okay, fine, I’ll take down the tweet,” she recalls conceding. “But just so you know, I’m being told that this man wearing these T-shirts has freedom of speech, but I’m the one being told to take down a tweet. I feel like I’m being silenced.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmuyomtz000t3b7hy2zq1zd3@published data-word-count=77>Ross then said Murphy, who was directing on a different project at the time, called her immediately after. “You think that I would fucking&nbsp;silence&nbsp;you after all I’ve done, and I’ve been an advocate and done nothing but uplift trans Black women?” Ross remembers him saying, before backing down. “You know what? You are right. I’m sorry. I want to be your biggest champion. I understand the work you’re doing, and I want to be your biggest champion.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmuz40rg000x3b7h4h924zly@published>Does Murphy agree with this version of events?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmuz4hfu00113b7hu0x4pv5e@published data-word-count=102>Nope. In a statement to THR, Popa tells a different version of the event. From his perspective, when he called Ross, he told her that Murphy saw the tweet and preferred that Ross would bring issues directly to himself or Murphy rather than tweeting about it. Popa says that Ross responded that she felt silenced and after a bit more back and forth between the two, Murphy called her. He says that he heard the interaction, and disputes Ross’s account. Instead, in Popa’s description, what Murphy said was, “I don’t understand why you would go to Twitter instead of coming to us.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmuzb0td00153b7htq8wg06r@published>Okay so what were the screenshots about?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmuy6itb000l3b7htmu4pv6l@published data-word-count=125>In the screenshots Ross posted on September 18 from July 2020, Murphy follows up on Ross’s idea for a Black woman–focused season of AHS, potentially starring Ross, Keke Palmer, and Gabourey Sidibe, along with another Black woman who is yet to be determined. She also shared an email from <a href=#>almost two years later</a>, sent in February 2022, in which she follows up with Murphy about the project. In the email, Ross asks if she can be involved in the production side of the project as well. In the caption for the post, Ross reveals that when she sent that email, she was “still contractually in first position with the show,” and added, “Mind you, marvel had called twice now. I haven’t heard from him since.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmrtkrwc001h3b7hgaliad2s@published data-word-count=100>She further elaborated on Marvel’s relevancy in a later post responding to the Wrap’s telling of her story. Her continued contractual obligation to AHS meant that she couldn’t accept a Marvel job, despite not hearing back from Murphy. “I called business affairs for MONTHS trying to get clarity if they were picking up my contract option or if I was ok to tell Marvel that I was available for whatever they were calling me for,” she said in a post. “I had been auditioning for THREE YEARS for marvel. It’s that I was HELD in first position the whole time.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmv2hlrf000l3b6wvf1dfwv0@published data-word-count=56>Ross told THR her theory is that the treatment is because she did not fully condemn Janet Mock when she came out against Murphy. Ross says Mock told her, <a href=#>of her “fuck Hollywood” speech</a>, “Girl, you think this is the first time Ryan Murphy’s hearing me say any of this? I’ve said this all to him.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>It’s not JUST that the idea changed. Things change all the time.

In her THR interview, she describes the incident as beginning when Roberts “had not allowed the makeup team to age her that much.” “We were supposed to be aged several years,” Ross explained. “So I knew from the makeup department about what was going on. So she comes to set and I’m like, “Oh, you look rested.” Then, in her Instagram Live, she said Gray told them, “‘Okay, ladies, that’s enough, let’s get back to work.’” “She then looks at me and goes, ‘Don’t you mean lady?’” Ross said, adding that she stopped talking to Roberts on set because “there was someone who spoke up about what she was doing and they got repercussions from it. Not her, they did.” Ross further said that Roberts “had been playing mind games with everybody on this set.”</p><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/WHN35reTRm</a></p>— Pop Crave (@PopCrave) <a href=#>September 20, 2023</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmuzudnx00263b7h5aieyngz@published>Has Emma Roberts said anything?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmuzg2fw001l3b7huuv02hmq@published data-word-count=90>Publicly, no. However, on September 20, Ross tweeted that Roberts called her to apologize for her transphobic remarks and actions on the set of American Horror Story. “Thank you @RobertsEmma for calling and apologizing, recognizing your behavior was not that of an ally,” Ross <a href=#>posted</a>. “I will leave the line open to follow up on your desire to do better and support social justice causes with your platform.” Ross also asked that fans not joke about violence against Roberts. “Joke about her being held accountable,” <a href=#>she wrote</a>. “Now THATs funny.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmv08y2r002a3b7h6tu7xd4p@published data-word-count=71>She elaborated on that story in the THR interview calling it “ a bumpy conversation.” “You can’t call yourself an ally,” Ross said she told Roberts. “[Allyship] is an action. You need to be real with me in this conversation. I’m being real with you. You were being messy.” Roberts allegedly said that she “was really just referring to myself,” when she used the singular “lady,” which Ross does not believe.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmv0cwd8002e3b7hj4pxeqwp@published>Where does Angelica Ross go from here?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmv0g72n002i3b7htd9dwodb@published data-word-count=99>Not to AHS: Delicate! Ross says that, after being held on to by her AHS contracts with confirmation either way if she would be in the season for months, she ultimately called up business affairs herself. “What’s going on? Are we going back? When are we going back to work?” she asked. “They said, ‘Actually, I’m pulling the contracts right now, and yours is not in here. I don’t think you’re coming back to this season.’ That’s how I found out.&nbsp;It made me realize he thought that he can just kind of control my life like an on-and-off switch.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmv0jbpw002m3b7h5chgllwb@published data-word-count=57>Now, Ross is able to talk about this because she’s leaving Hollywood and moving to Atlanta in order to “run for office.” “I’m fully walking away from Hollywood,” she told THR. “But I’m always going to be who I am. You don’t have to be on TV to be a creative person, to live a creative life.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmv46doz000d3b7joltsom1i@published data-word-count=5>This post has been updated.</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>The Hollywood Reporter</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjxxhzg27031ms3y6y06u4yaa@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Angelica Ross on Heartbreaking Pose Episode: ‘Why Me?’</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clgb18q6700000ij3ly5p986x@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>American Horror Story: Delicate Trailer is a Jump-Scare for Gilmore Girls Fans</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cljrydn9u00000iht6fgokrf8@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Ryan Murphy Is Apparently Beefing With a Former WGA Strike Captain</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Angelica Ross Has Receipts</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnyiusaeo6KbkWK%2FsL%2FSZpihq12nxqK6jKasq6iYrnqmucyaZKunkpq%2Ftb%2BNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fangelica-ross-ahs-ryan-murphy-emma-roberts-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fangelica-ross-ahs-ryan-murphy-emma-roberts-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fangelica-ross-ahs-ryan-murphy-emma-roberts-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fangelica-ross-ahs-ryan-murphy-emma-roberts-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fangelica-ross-ahs-ryan-murphy-emma-roberts-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fangelica-ross-ahs-ryan-murphy-emma-roberts-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-do-you-reset-the-uconnect-on-a-chrysler-300.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-do-you-reset-the-uconnect-on-a-chrysler-300.html>How do you reset the uconnect on a chrysler 300</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./alan-krashesky-wls-bio-wiki-age-family-wife-salary-net-worth-channel-7-retire-and-home.html>Alan Krashesky WLS: Bio, Wiki, Age, Family, Wife, Salary, Net Worth, Channel 7, Retire and Home</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./alan-krashesky-wls-bio-wiki-age-family-wife-salary-net-worth-channel-7-retire-and-home.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
