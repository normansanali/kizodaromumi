Suddenly, he was.</p>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jhDJkI eZknfg">Jennifer Tisdale</a><p class="sc-ensa-Dq fPmIpI">May 16 2024, Published 10:12 p.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/Law&Crime Network</a></figure><p>In April 2023, Kouri Richins was a guest on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Day Utah</a> talk show. She came on to discuss Are You With Me? — a children's book she wrote. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Goodreads</a> describes it as a "heartwarming and reassuring book that gently guides children through the difficult experience of losing a loved one." Richins was writing from experience as her husband Eric Richins died almost a year earlier on March 4, 2022, of a fentanyl overdose.</p><p>Richins told the hosts that she hoped to help other children through a grieving process that she and her kids were still dealing with. The book's purpose was to help children understand that just because someone is gone, it doesn't mean they are no longer with them. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC 4,</a> Richins was arrested a month later and charged with "aggravated murder and three counts of possession of drugs with intent to distribute." Where is she now? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/Law&Crime Network</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Where is Kouri Richins now? She might be headed for a trial.</h2><p>On May 15, 2024, a Utah judge delayed Richins's hearing to determine whether or not the state had enough evidence to move forward with a trial, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">COURT TV</a>. The prosecution is responsible for showing Richins had probable cause for committing the crimes she is accused of. The hearing will be scheduled between June 18–21 because prosecutors need three days to go over their material.</p><p>In response to the postponement, Richins's lawyer Skye Lazaro said her client was very unhappy, via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KUTV</a>. Lazaro said they didn't expect this but she will "continue to defend Kouri's rights." She also said, "We were prepared to go forward today. Unfortunately and understandably, she's really disappointed. She has to wait another five weeks, given the length of time that she's been in jail."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What happened to Eric Richins?</h2><p>Before Eric died, another strange incident occurred a month earlier on Valentine's Day. Prosecutors allege that Richins purchased fentanyl mere days before he had an allergic reaction to a sandwich, reports <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a>. Apparently, Eric broke out into hives after eating a sandwich Richins bought for him from his favorite place. After using his son's EpiPen, he took some Benadryl and passed out. Hours later he texted a friend, "I think my wife tried to poison me."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/Law&Crime Network</a></figure><p>Less than a month later, Eric was found dead in the bedroom he shared with Richins. The cause of death would later be determined as fentanyl intoxication. He had ingested a lethal amount. Richins told police that earlier that evening she made the two of them Moscow Mules to celebrate something work-related.</p><p>The prosecution believes Richins's motive was financial. She flipped houses and used a line of credit on a home Eric owned before marrying Richins, says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Law & Crime</a>. Forensic accountants are prepared to testify that Richins was borrowing money at high interest rates to fund the house flipping. Three months before Eric died, Richins was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sued by Green Grass Holdings</a> for defaulting on a loan.</p><p>No money was coming in and when Eric died, Richins "owed $3.1 million dollars via properties she purchased." Her husband's estate was worth $5 million and he had a life insurance policy valued at $2 million. The judge presiding over the hearing was very interested in texts exchanged between Richins and one witness in which she wrote, "It would be better if Eric was dead." She might feel differently now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLy2vshmqaKbmJ67tHnNqK4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkouri-richins-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkouri-richins-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkouri-richins-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkouri-richins-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkouri-richins-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkouri-richins-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-magic-johnsons-son-ej-johnson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-magic-johnsons-son-ej-johnson.html>Who is Magic Johnsons son EJ Johnson?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kelly-marie-lancien.html>Where Is Daniel Ducruet Now?
