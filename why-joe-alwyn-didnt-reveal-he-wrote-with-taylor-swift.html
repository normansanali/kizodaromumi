Her songs Lover, London Boy, and Invisible String <a href=#>are very obviously written about Alwyn according to fans.</a> Swift revealed that the two decided to keep their relationship quiet in her documentary, Miss Americana, because they both agreed on wanting it to stay private. Especially after all the drama Swift was involved in with Kim and Kanye, it made sense that Swift wanted a lot of her life to stay private after that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the documentary, fans could see a brief glimpse into Swift and Alwyn's relationship. <a href=#>In one scene, Taylor hugs him</a> behind the scenes at one of her shows on tour.
