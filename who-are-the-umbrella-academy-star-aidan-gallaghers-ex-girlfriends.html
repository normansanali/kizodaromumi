While there are many supernatural shows out there, this one stands out as its concept is so fascinating: when&nbsp;a rich man adopts seven kids, he creates "The Umbrella Academy," a group of superheroes. They all have their own powers and it's a really fun and&nbsp;exciting series to watch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After watching <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">season 2 of The Umbrella Academy</a>, which started streaming on Netflix in July 2020, one question is on fans' minds: what is Aidan Gallagher's dating&nbsp;life like? The actor plays the character named The Boy/Number Five, who has the magical ability to move through time and space. He doesn't seem to be in a relationship currently, but he has dated many people. Let's take a look at his ex-girlfriends...</p><h2 id=madisyn-shipman>Madisyn Shipman</h2><p>Aidan Gallagher has gotten some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">negative comments online</a>, but since he has starred in such a big Netflix show, people are curious about his love life.</p><p>Aidan Gallagher and Madisyn Shipman&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dated in 2016</a>, and&nbsp;Netflix Life&nbsp;says their romance spanned May to August of that year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress has 1.8 million followers on Instagram and her bio reads, "Stay true to yourself even in darkness & humble in the spotlight." She is famous for playing&nbsp;Kenzie Bell on the TV show&nbsp;Game Shakers, which aired on&nbsp;Nickelodeon. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shipman is also a singer</a> and she knew even as a toddler that she was meant to be performing. She would put on plays for the people in her life and also at the daycare that she attended.</p><h2 id=hannah-mccloud>Hannah McCloud</h2><p>Aidan Gallagher and Hannah McCloud started seeing each other in February 2017. According to&nbsp;Netflix Life, they aren't together anymore.</p><p>Superbhub.com&nbsp;says that Aidan shared a photo of the couple on April 30th, 2017. They were together for a period of eight months. He said that "each day and night with her gets better and better," according to the website, but once they split up, he made sure to get rid of the social media post.</p><p>McCloud is an actress whose credits include&nbsp;Revenge,&nbsp;Tenured, and&nbsp;I'll Be Next Door For Christmas, according to her&nbsp;IMDb.com&nbsp;page.</p><h2 id=jessica-belkin>Jessica Belkin</h2><p>It looks like Gallagher has dated quite a few actors, as there is someone else who is part of his past love life who works in that field.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Netflix Life&nbsp;says that Aidan Gallagher and Jessica Belkin were in a relationship starting in February 2015 and ending in April 2016.</p><p>Belkin is a successful actress who has had roles on many popular TV shows, such as&nbsp;Vampire Girl/WrenWren on&nbsp;American Horror Story, and Bethany Young on&nbsp;Pretty Little Liars, the girl who was buried alive instead of Alison DiLaurentis. Some of her other credits include&nbsp;American Housewife&nbsp;and&nbsp;Just Add Magic.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Umbrella Academy’s Justin Min Describes First Meeting With Ritu Arya</a></span></p><h2 id=trinity-rose>Trinity Rose</h2><p>Netflix Life&nbsp;says that Trinity Rose and Gallagher worked on a song called "Miss You" together and people think that they dated. It makes sense that that rumor would get started as people are often curious if actors on the same TV show are dating IRL or if things have gotten romantic between two leads in a movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In May 2019, Dankanator.com interviewed the singer, and she shared that she had always been interested in music. She explained, "I have been singing all my life. I have been singing with my parents when we would have these music nights with some neighborhood kids. Basically, I have always been into musical theatre and I did this musical with my 5th-grade teacher Mr. Lantos. And he gave me the leading role and I just started performing then and there because I hadn’t really performed before. I realized how much I loved musical theatre and performing general singing. So that’s kind of where it all started."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘The Umbrella Academy’: Emmy Raver-Lampman Says ‘Civil Rights And BLM Movements Are The Same’</a></span></p><h2 id=his-time-on-the-umbrella-academy>His Time On 'The Umbrella Academy'</h2><p>It sounds like Aidan Gallagher has really enjoyed playing Number Five on this popular Netflix show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor spoke to&nbsp;Teen Vogue&nbsp;about the experience. He described filming the show as&nbsp;"like shooting five movies" and continued,&nbsp;“You're working with a cast of incredibly talented 30-year-olds who all know what their mission is. When you're in seeing someone like Ellen Page, and you're right then, it's just the two of you. You're locked in. There's this incredible subtlety and control of the actor who's sitting across from you that you’re really required to step up your game.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Are Henry Cavill’s Ex Girlfriends?</a></span></p><p>Aidan Gallagher may be 16 years old but the teenage actor definitely has a fairly long list of ex-girlfriends.
