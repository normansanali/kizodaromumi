Over the course of his career, he has garnered multiple awards including two Oscars, two BAFTAs, and four Golden Globes. Seeing that these two are somewhat rivals in the industry, fans often wonder if they are friends outside of work. Not exactly! But Tarantino and Nolan are definitely not enemies either.

Back in 2018, Nolan made headlines after sharing his thoughts on the popular streaming platform Netflix. Expectedly, this does not sit well with some parties. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The director later sent a written letter to Netflix's Chief content officer</a>, Ted Sarandos, apologizing for how his statements might have affected the company. Tarantino has also been quite vocal in sharing his thoughts about online streaming services. The director once revealed that he did not have a Netflix account, further proving his allegiance to the old ways.&nbsp;In essence, both Nolan and Tarantino believe theatre is still relevant in filmmaking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nolan-s-films-confuses-tarantino-sometimes><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Nolan's Films Confuses Tarantino Sometimes</span></h2><p>Nolan and Tarantino are perhaps each other's biggest critics so it is not uncommon to find the two men talking about each other's works.

He described the movie as a classic, adding that it is part of his top-ranking favorites. Though initially ranked number seven on his list of top movies of the 2010s, a third re-watch opened Tarantino's eyes to h0w good the film is.&nbsp;"It wasn’t until the third time that I could see past the spectacle and into the people the story is about.

There, Nolan described the movie as "one hell of a movie" while also commending Tarantino for bringing back the beauty of seeing a movie at the theatre. Nolan further relayed that he perceived "an increased level of formalism," adding that there was a calm thought towards the camera positions in the film. Tarantino also once described Dunkirk as a "symphony" where everything works. With the film, Tarantino believes Nolan put himself in the sphere of the greatest filmmakers of all time.
