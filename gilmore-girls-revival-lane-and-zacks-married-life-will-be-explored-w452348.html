<time>09 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The band is back together! Zack Van Gerbig and Lane Kim are returning to Stars Hollow for the <i>Gilmore Girls</i> revival — but whether their marriage is still solid remains a mystery.</p><p><b>Todd Lowe</b>, who played rocker Zack on the beloved series, opened up exclusively with <i>Us Weekly </i>about the TV couple in a new interview.</p><p>“It’s about seven years later and we’ll see how married life has affected them,” Lowe, 39, tells<i> Us</i>. “They fell in love by just proximity to each other and sharing musical interests. They just happened to mesh really well.”</p><p>Zack and Hep Alien bandmate Lane, played by <b>Keiko Agena</b>, tied the knot in season 6 and are parents of twin sons Steve and Kwan. Zack had to work hard to impress Lane’s strict mom, Ms. Kim (<b>Emily Kuroda</b>), and left off in season 7 going on tour with the band.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/323_gilmoregirls_101_sum_01836r_todd-lowe-keiko-agena-gilmore-girls-zoom-42b7b608-a3d5-4647-be0f-229ca8bccd3e.jpg><p>“I can play this character for the rest of my life. It’s not like I have to step into a second skin to play Zack,” Lowe tells <i>Us</i>. “Zack was a bit of a rock snob, so I enjoyed that part of it.”</p><p>One of Lowe’s favorite Zack and Lane moments was their first kiss. “I had Brian (<b>John Cabrera</b>) on my shoulders,” he says. “I thought that was a really well-written, awkwardly staged, and still somewhat romantic first kiss, so that has a special significance for me.”</p><p><i>Gilmore Girls </i>was Lowe’s first acting gig in L.A. — and he vividly remembers his audition. “There was a guitar in the room. They wanted us to be somewhat musical. I sang a Pixies song, ‘Where Is My Mind?’ and I sang it in German, like a German English. It was a Zack thing to do,” he recalls.</p><p>“It was our first Hep Alien scene where we were rehearsing and Brian had some line about his deviated septum,” he adds. “I read it a few times through and I thought it was going to be one episode of work and much to my delight, my agent called me a few weeks later and said, ‘Hey, block out these weeks because they want you for four more.’ Then five more, then six more and it just kept building… I moved here from Texas and it was really validating to know that I can work on a television show and I didn’t make a crazy choice with my life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/tcdgigi_ec113_h_keiko-agena-todd-lowe-gilmore-girls-zoom-b6d739f1-f482-442c-9545-0a64748ca118.jpg><p><i>For more with Lowe, read the rest of his Q&A:</i></p><p><b>US WEEKLY: What are similarities and differences between you and Zack?</b></p><p><b>TODD LOWE: </b>Zack used to have a lot more hair! Mine is starting to go. I’m more of a country musician. That’s kind of in my wheelhouse. Zack has more of an indie rock vibe to him… They have to put another inch on the waistline [in the revival].</p><p><b>US: How would you describe him in three words?</b></p><p><b>TL:</b> Arrogant, caring and a little dim.</p><p><b>US: What was it like after Adam Brody left for <i>The O.C.</i>?</b></p><p><b>TL: </b>Hep Alien is an anagram for Helen Pai, who was <b>Amy [Sherman-Palladino’s]</b> close friend growing up. She was also the music producer on the show. Her husband, in real life, his name is Dave Rygalski. So obviously, I think that Adam, who played Dave Rygalski, I think he was destined to hook up with Lane. But he left, so much better fortune for me.</p><p><b>US: What was something fun that happened behind-the-scenes on the original series?</b></p><p><b>TL:</b> I got really good at playing chess. A lot of the crew guys would have chess boards and we’d play timed chess. So we did that and <b>Jared [Padalecki]</b> beat me, I do remember that very distinctly.</p><p><b>US: Did you take any props from set?</b></p><p><b>TL: </b>I took a tambourine and a Hep Alien T-shirt. But I’m not too nostalgic that way.</p><p><b>US: Are you Team Dean, Jess or Logan?</b></p><p><b>TL: </b>I think the smart answer to say is I’m Team Rory. She doesn’t need a man to define her.</p><p><b>US: Are you going to watch the revival when it debuts after Thanksgiving?</b></p><p><b>TL: </b>I’m gonna binge it — with a belly full of turkey.</p><p><i>Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life</i> premieres on Netflix on Friday, November 25.</p><p>Lowe can also be seen in the drama <i>Cold</i> on Thursdays, which is available on go90 (iOS and Android) and <a href=#>www.go90.com.</a> The star plays a criminal named Thomas in the New Form Digital-created series.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6ipJ2kv6Z5xqKppatdp7K3tdWao2akkaOybq3NnWSzmZOgwG65wKupop2UYrmqssRmrqKknGKvpnnEsaelp6KasW7Dk25pbGxoZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgilmore-girls-revival-lane-and-zacks-married-life-will-be-explored-w452348.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgilmore-girls-revival-lane-and-zacks-married-life-will-be-explored-w452348.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgilmore-girls-revival-lane-and-zacks-married-life-will-be-explored-w452348.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgilmore-girls-revival-lane-and-zacks-married-life-will-be-explored-w452348.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgilmore-girls-revival-lane-and-zacks-married-life-will-be-explored-w452348.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgilmore-girls-revival-lane-and-zacks-married-life-will-be-explored-w452348.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jamie-mcshane-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jamie-mcshane-2.html>Jamie McShane Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./claudio-sanchez-net-worth-2024.html>Claudio Sanchez Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./claudio-sanchez-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
