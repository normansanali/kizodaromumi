Being a physicist and activist, it only seems natural for him to opt-out of an electric vehicle.</p><p>For the record, the car currently has a market price ranging from <strong>$90,000</strong> for the base model to <strong>$207,000</strong> for the top-end variant.</p><p>He shared that the car has very high acceleration in the same conversation, and there’s no maintenance and oil change, no pistons, nothing.</p><p>Being an enthusiast himself, he understands that <strong>Tesla X</strong> is a game-changer and wishes cars like these were there a hundred years ago.</p><p>On being asked whether he liked all the tech in it, Neil replied,</p><p>That f***ing car is the future. Tesla is the future.</p><p>Moreover, his affection towards Tesla was shown a while ago when he said he’d want a Tesla Roadster as one of the cars he’d absolutely love to own.</p><h2><span

id=lifestyle></span>Lifestyle<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Neil is pretty much a minimal guy who really prefers to enjoy the smaller things of life when it comes to lifestyle.</p><p>He spends his quality time with his family, taking as many precautions as he can to avoid covid, for the time.</p><p>Apparently, he spends his additional time honing his cooking skills and visualizing content for his new book.</p><p>Sometime soon, he thinks he’ll be giving his kids driving lessons too.</p><p>Social media is probably one of his most important platforms for connections and sharing his thoughts.</p><p>He’s been active on Twitter for a long time, and it’s here that he shares most of his knowledge and experiences.</p><p>Furthermore, Humor has always been a key attribute that makes Neil so lovable.</p><p>He uses humor in most of his posts and talks to connect with the audience deeper.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=vacations></span>Vacations<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>It’s not always the stars and the cosmos that have baffled Neil.</p><p>This planet has several such dumbfounding places that have fascinated the astrophysicist.</p><p>The <strong>meteor crater</strong> in Arizona and the <strong>Grand Canyon</strong> are places that were carved due to natural occurrences and are a good example of how grand and unpredictable the universe really is.</p><p>Another such place that he recommends is <strong>Kruger Park</strong> in South Africa.</p><p>There are large mammals that reminded him that he was not alone on this planet and that we share this environment with tons of other species.</p><p>Furthermore, he describes his family vacation on a cruise ship in <strong>Greece and Turkey</strong> to be the most memorable experience of his life.</p><p>Apparently, looking at the place from a tourist guide’s perspective made the trip fascinating.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=charity></span>Charity<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As for charity, Neil has been known to support a wide range of causes through different outlets.</p><p><strong>Doctors without Borders</strong> and <strong>PETA</strong> are the organizations that the astrophysicist has reportedly supported.</p><p>Furthermore, he has also been known to support organizations related to education and space in the form of <strong>Chess in Schools, HEAF, and The Planetary Society.</strong></p><p>Moreover, Tyson is also an avid supporter of causes related to <strong>youth, animals, disaster relief, and health sectors.</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=neil-degrasse-tyson-movies-tv-shows-media-appearances></span>Neil deGrasse Tyson: Movies & TV Shows, Media Appearances<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=movies-tv-shows></span>Movies & TV Shows<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>When talking about movies & TV shows, this area is more of a comfortable play zone where Neil has had years of experience.</p><p>Being a part of the scientific community, he’s had his fair share of the media for a long time.</p><p>Though, his distinct characteristic of pleasing people got him more further in this line of work.</p><p>Tyson started hosting <strong>“NovaScienceNow,”</strong> one of his appreciated shows in 2004, the <strong>“Startalk“</strong> podcast in 2009, “Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey” in 2014.</p><p>All 3 of these shows have been loved by enthusiasts for years now.</p><p>Furthermore, the “StartTalk” podcast is still going on, and “Cosmos” just got another season a year back.</p><p>Aside from his roles as a host, he’s appeared in several other movies, and TV shows too.</p><p>The biggest flex is that in most of these variations, he usually appears as himself.</p><p><strong>“Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” “Lazer Team,” “Zoolander 2“, “The Last Sharknado: It’s About Time“</strong> are the movies that he’s attended.</p><p>While <strong>“The Big Bang Theory,” “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” “Stargate: Atlantis,” “The Jim Gaffigan Show“</strong> are the shows that have seen his presence.</p><p>Moreover, a lot of animated movies have included him as a voice actor too.</p><p><strong>“Ice Age: Collision Course,” “Family Guy,” “Bojack Horseman,” and “The Simpsons“</strong> are the ones that have gone through with this prospect.</p><p>With the way things are going, Neil will likely appear in several upcoming shows and movies too.</p><p>I, for one, am looking forward to his appearance in “Rick and Morty.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=media-appearances></span>Media Appearances<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He has quite an impact on the media too. He’s appeared several times on The Daily Show with John Stewart.</p><p>Furthermore, he’s also made appearances on <strong>Late Night with Conan O’Brien, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, and The Rachel Maddow Show.</strong></p><p>Moreover, he’s appeared numerous times on <strong>Real Time with Bill Maher</strong> and even been featured on an episode of <strong>Who wants to be a millionaire.</strong></p><p>As for interviews, he’s shown face in <strong>The skeptic’s guide to the Universe, Radiolab, Skepticality, and The Joe Rogan Experience podcast.</strong></p><p>Apart from that, he’s also been a keynote speaker in some scenes too.</p><p>Deerfield Academy, The Amazing Meeting, and the skepticism conference hosted by James Randi Educational foundations are some of the memorable ones.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=neil-degrasse-tyson-career></span>Neil deGrasse Tyson: Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When we talk about career, most of Tyson’s work has always focused on <strong>cosmology, the study of the universe, and all of its components.</strong></p><p>He has held a couple of prestigious titles in this field, which remains intact to this day. Tyson has admired the Hayden Planetarium for a long time now.</p><p>He started as a staff scientist on the planetarium in 1994, when he was still a research affiliate at Princeton University.</p><p>He rose to acting director in June 1995 and actual director in 1996.</p><p>Since then, that position hasn’t seen and maybe won’t ever see anybody else make such an impact for the planetarium.</p><p>He oversaw the <strong>$210 million</strong> reconstruction project, which made the planetarium what it is today.</p><p>Besides his titles, he is also known for his books and columns on astronomy.</p><p>He’s authored 13 books and, over the course of years, wrote many columns and articles.</p><p>It’s not just that; he’s been a part of a couple of expeditions on the president’s requests too.</p><p>In 2001, he served on the <strong>“Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry”</strong> campaign.</p><p>Following that, he was appointed for the <strong>“Moon, Mars, and Beyond”</strong> Commission for which, he soon after received the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal!</p><p>Tyson is one of the reasons why Pluto is not considered a planet anymore.</p><p>He was and still is a key figure in public discussion against pluto’s status as a planet.</p><p>There’s also a book about it, titled <strong>“The Pluto Files.”</strong></p><p>Aside from all that, he has also been a vice president, president, and chairman of the board of the Planetary Society.</p><p>And, let’s not forget his numerous roles as an actor and host for many shows and movies.</p><p>Read About Tarek El Moussa Net Worth, Television Career & Lifestyle</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=3-facts-about-neil-degrasse-tyson></span>3 Facts About Neil deGrasse Tyson<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Tyson was voted as the guy with the “Coolest Job” at his high school’s 20-year reunion.</li><li>Surprisingly, Tyson was pretty active in several dance styles when he was in college.
