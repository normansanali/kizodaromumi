Then, he moved with his family to Long Island in New York.</p><p>Likewise, in the year 2001, he graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, with a B.A. in history.</p><h2><span id=Jesse_Watters_8211_Net_Worth_2023>Jesse Watters – Net Worth 2023</span></h2><p>Talking about his earnings, according to Celebritynetworth, he has a <strong>net worth</strong> of $5 million. His main income source is his hosting career.</p><h2><span id=Controversies>Controversies</span></h2><p>He has drawn criticism for numerous provocative and inaccurate statements. On the twelfth anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks, he stated on Fox News’s O’Reilly Factor that when acts of domestic terrorism are committed, “It is always a Muslim”.</p><p>Likewise, in January 2017, he faulted John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager, for the theft of Podesta’s emails by Russian hackers, saying, “What happened was John Podesta gave his password to a hacker.</p><p>And guess what his password was. ‘Password.’ It’s a true story. His password was ‘password'”. The fact-checking website PolitiFact rated Watter’s claim “False”.</p><p>According to Media Matters, on climate change, he has even stated “You can fight climate change with suntan lotion. It’s not that big of a deal.”</p><p>Regarding President Trump’s policy of separating children from their families, he has said that “some would say it’s a more humane policy” than keeping them together.</p><p>Moreover, according to an article by Michael Houltt on The Business Standard News, he quoted, “Just imagine how well KFC and marijuana dispensaries will do in black communities,” on the Fox show The Five.</p><h4>Amanda Terkel “ambush”</h4><p>In the year&nbsp; 2009, on assignment for The O’Reilly Factor, he along with his cameraman accosted journalist Amanda Terkel. She was on vacation and they approached her to ask questions about an article she wrote that was critical of Bill O’Reilly.</p><p>Seven years later, at a journalists’ reception, The Huffington Post’s Ryan Grim approached him along with his phone camera running and asked him to walk over to Terkel and apologize.</p><p>Watters at first said he would apologize and then said he wouldn’t, adding, “I ambushed her because O’Reilly told me to get her because she said some bad shit”.</p><p>Moreover, the video of the incident shows him grabbing Grim’s phone and throwing it on the floor, and later grabbing it again and putting it in his pocket.</p><p>And then, the two of them got into a shoving match, as Grim attempted to recover his phone. He later commented on the incident on The O’Reilly Factor, stating, “I was at this party trying to enjoy myself. This guy came up to me. He started putting it in my face”.</p><p>Terkel wrote that his response was surprising, considering that his way of confronting his subjects is to thrust cameras in their faces unexpectedly and pepper them with aggressive questions.</p><h4>Chinatown segment</h4><p>In October 2016, he was criticized for a segment of Watters’ World that was widely considered racist toward Asian Americans.</p><p>In New York City’s Chinatown, he asked Chinese Americans if they knew karate and if he should bow before he greets them, or if their watches were stolen. Throughout the segment, the 1974 song “Kung Fu Fighting” plays in the background.</p><p>The interviews are interspersed with references to martial arts and clips of Watters getting a foot massage and playing with nunchucks.</p><p>New York City mayor Bill de Blasio denounced Watters’ segment as “vile, racist behavior” and that has no place in our city. Also, numerous other lawmakers and journalists, including Asian Americans Mazie Hirono and Judy Chu, condemned Watters.</p><p>This segment was also criticized by the Asian American Journalists Association, which issued a statement saying: “We should be far beyond tired, racist stereotypes and targeting an ethnic group for humiliation and objectification based on their race”.</p><p>On October 5, he tweeted what Variety’s Will Thorne called a “non-apology” about the segment.</p><p>In the two tweets, he stated: “My man-on-the-street interviews are meant to be taken as tongue-in-cheek and I regret if anyone found offense and as a political humorist, the Chinatown segment was intended to be a light piece, as all Watters’ World segments are”.</p><h4>Ivanka Trump comments</h4><p>Two days after joining The Five as co-host, Watters made an on-air comment about Ivanka Trump that was criticized as lewd in April 2017.</p><p>Then, after viewing footage of Trump speaking on a panel about female entrepreneurship, he again commented, “So I don’t get what’s going on here, but I liked how she was speaking into that microphone”. He even parodied holding the microphone as a phallic symbol.</p><p>Furthermore, he denied his comment was sexual, saying in a statement,</p><p>“During the break, we were commenting on Ivanka’s voice and how it was low and steady and resonates like a smooth jazz radio DJ and this was in no way a joke about anything else”.</p><p>And in response to the criticism, he was not on the show for two days that week.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>After graduating from college, Jesse Watters began working as a production assistant at Fox News.

Also, he has said, “I try to make it enjoyable for the person I’m interviewing.</p><p>We always come away from the interview all smiles, for the most part, and it’s always fun to come back and look at the footage and say, ‘Oh my gosh, what just happened?'”.</p><p>Moreover, in January 2017, “Watters’ World” became a weekly show.
