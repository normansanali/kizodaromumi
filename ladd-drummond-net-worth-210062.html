Ladd Drummond is based in Pawhuska, Oklahoma where he lives with his wife and four children. His wife, <a href=#>Ree Drummond</a>, is the author of the popular blog, Pioneer Woman, which chronicles life on their ranch, where they raise 2,500 head of cattle and horses. <a href=#>Ree Drummond</a>'s blog has spawned books, and a Food Network series, as well. Ladd Drummond was already working as a cowboy when Ree met him, and is a fourth-generation cattle rancher. She left her corporate life behind in order to join him on the ranch. He and the rest of the family love fantasy football and the couple home school their children. His wife's blog, and some of his comments, made during interviews and specials about the family, have caused other ranchers to criticize the family and their ranching practices.</p><p>Ladd Drummond's family is the 23rd largest land owner in the United States. As a family, they own an astonishing 433,000 acres of land over 675 square miles. According to a government report, in the last 10 years, the Drummond family has been paid more than $24 million in rent from the United States government alone. Most of the rent payments have been to continue supporting animal protection on their vast property. The Ladd family operates the Drummond Land & Cattle Co which was founded by family patriarch Fred Drummond in the late 1800s after he emigrated from Scotland. Accroding to government records, the Drummond company is owned by just four people.</p><p>The couple married in 1996 and have four children together: Alex born in 1997, Paige born in 1999, Bryce born in 2002, and Todd born in 2004. The Drummonds starred on the reality TV series The Pioneer Woman starting in 2011. The show has run for 15 seasons and 180 episodes on the Food Network through 2016.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeclrGlecOrrKaln6OxbrrErWSwp6KptW5%2BkGlnb2o%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fladd-drummond-net-worth-210062.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fladd-drummond-net-worth-210062.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fladd-drummond-net-worth-210062.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fladd-drummond-net-worth-210062.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fladd-drummond-net-worth-210062.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fladd-drummond-net-worth-210062.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./maggie-haberman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-379854-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./maggie-haberman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-379854-html.html>Maggie Haberman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jason-hoppy-net-worth.html>Jason Hoppy Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jason-hoppy-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
