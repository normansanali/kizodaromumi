After all, you want your child to <a href=#>succeed</a> and feel like they are getting a fair chance to show their skills on the field or court. However, it's important to consider a few key factors before approaching the coach.</p><p>First and foremost, it's essential to evaluate your child's performance objectively. Are they putting in the effort and showing improvement in practice? Are they demonstrating good sportsmanship and teamwork during games? If the answer is yes, then it may be worth discussing playing time with the coach.</p><p>However, it's important to approach this conversation in a respectful and professional manner. Remember that the coach has a lot of responsibilities, and their decisions are based on what they believe is best for the team as a whole. If you come across as demanding or confrontational, it could hurt your child's relationship with the coach and potentially impact their playing time in the future.</p><p>When speaking with the coach, it's important to focus on your child's development rather than their playing time. By emphasizing the importance of growth and improvement, you can work with the coach to develop a plan for your child to succeed in the long term. This could involve setting specific goals for your child to work towards or identifying areas where they can improve their skills.</p><p>It's also important to keep in mind that playing time isn't everything. While it's natural to want your child to get as much time on the field as possible, it's important to emphasize the importance of teamwork and supporting their teammates, even if they are not playing as much as they would like. By doing so, you can help your child develop important life skills that will serve them well both on and off the field.</p><p>Another key factor to consider is your child's age and level of <a href=#>competition</a>. If they are playing at a young age, it's important to remember that playing time may not be as important as simply having fun and learning the fundamentals of the sport. In these cases, it may be best to let the coach make decisions about playing time without interference.</p><p>On the other hand, if your child is playing at a more competitive level, it may be worth discussing playing time with the coach. However, it's important to remember that playing time is often earned through hard work and dedication, and it's important to encourage your child to continue putting in the effort to improve their skills and earn their place on the team.</p><p>Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to talk to your child's coach about playing time is a personal one. However, by approaching the conversation with respect and focusing on your child's long-term development, you can work with the coach to create a plan that benefits everyone involved. Remember that the most important thing is for your child to enjoy the <a href=#>sport</a> and develop important life skills along the way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6sn6itnJl6qnnTmqOkZaSkeq7FjKSgnatdmLyir8dmmJunpal6sbjAsqCnn12ptq6x</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshould-i-talk-to-my-kids-coach-about-playing-time.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fshould-i-talk-to-my-kids-coach-about-playing-time.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fshould-i-talk-to-my-kids-coach-about-playing-time.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fshould-i-talk-to-my-kids-coach-about-playing-time.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshould-i-talk-to-my-kids-coach-about-playing-time.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshould-i-talk-to-my-kids-coach-about-playing-time.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./this-is-how-dance-mom-star-nia-sioux-frazier-has-increased-her-net-worth-to-2-million.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./this-is-how-dance-mom-star-nia-sioux-frazier-has-increased-her-net-worth-to-2-million.html>This Is How 'Dance Mom' Star Nia Has Increased Her Net Worth To $2 Million</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sade-adu-and-daughter-hug-it-out.html>SADE ADU AND DAUGHTER HUG IT OUT</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sade-adu-and-daughter-hug-it-out.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
