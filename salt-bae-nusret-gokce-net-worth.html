However, under the alias Salt Bae, he is best known for videos and internet memes in which he “artistically” and rather “sensually” cooks and prepares steaks and meat which quickly went viral and became a genuine internet sensation.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how much wealth this popular chef has accumulated so far? How rich Salt Bae is? According to sources, it is estimated that the total of Salt Bae’s net worth, as of early 2018, revolves around the sum of $800,000 which has been acquired through his culinary and business career which has been active since 2010.</p><h3><strong>Salt Bae Net Worth $800,000</strong></h3><p>Nusret was born as one out of four children to Fatma and Faik Gökçe, and apart from Turkish is also of Kurdish ancestry. As he stated himself, he grew up in poverty and began working as a kitchen runner and dishwasher at the age of just 14. After acquiring his chef and butcher certificates, he opened his first restaurant in Istanbul back in 2010 – a small establishment with only 10 employees and just eight tables. In the course of the next several years, Nusret travelled to Argentina as well as the USA and Japan where he dived further into the meat industry, deepening his passion for meat and cooking. All these efforts helped Nusret Gökçe to make a name for himself in the restaurant business and also provided the basis for his current net worth.</p><p>Over the years, Salt Bae managed to expand his business empire by opening several more restaurants all across Turkey before, in 2014, he opened his first steakhouse in Dubai. Following the commercial success of his previous business efforts, in 2017 he opened a restaurant in Abu Dhabi too. What began as a small steakhouse, over the years overgrown to a chain of 13 restaurants with over 600 employees. The most recent additions to Nusret Gökçe’s business empire are locations in Doha, Qatar, as well as Miami, Florida, and New York City which is currently in its finishing stages before opening. Doubtlessly, all these endeavors have helped Salt Bae to add a significant sum to the total of his net worth.</p><p>However, to a greater prominence Nusret came in January 2017 when video “Ottoman Steak” picturing him preparing a steak in his unique and passionate way, showing flamboyant cooking skills went viral and gained huge popularity. For his unique way of sprinkling salt, letting it fall across his forearm, directly on the meat, Nusret was immediately named Salt Bae. The video had been seen more than 10 million times during the 2017, earning a huge dose of fame to Nusret as well as to his chain of restaurants. He became globally recognized not only for his sensational culinary skills and “almost erotic appreciation for a hefty slice of meat”, but also for his visual appearance – tight black and white outfit completed with black round sunglasses. Salt Bae almost overnight became an internet attraction, causing an avalanche of internet memes which certainly made an impact on his popularity as well as overall wealth.</p><p>When it comes to his personal life, there aren’t much relevant details about Salt Bae’s private matters, except that he is a father of nine children. Throughout his international steakhouse chain, Nusret has served a handful of celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Tommy Hilfiger and American Olympic medalist gymnast Simone Biles. He is quite active on several social media networks where he has been followed by over 10.5 million fans altogether.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=11.40447761194><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$800,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>1983</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Paşalı, Turkey</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Chef, Butcher, Businessperson</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Turkish</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Faik Gökçe, Fatma Gökçe</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Uğur Gökçe, Özgür Gökçe, Erman Gökçe</td></tr><tr readability=0.31372549019608><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/pg/SaltBaeOfficial</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/nusr_ett</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.42857142857143><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/nusr_et</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Movies</td><td>Salt bae The Turkish butcher Nusret Gökçe Salt bae (2017, video compilation)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>TV Shows</td><td>Salt Bae Turkish Chef Nusret Gokce instagram videos #saltbae / New video / Nusr-et Steakhouse (2017), Salt bae Nusret Gokce and Turkish chef Halil (2017), NUSRET STEAKHOUSE - THE TURKISH #SALTBAE (2017), THE SALT BAE DUBAI EXPERIENCE!!
