Here’s everything we know about the timeline surrounding Tom and Gisele’s new relationships.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Selena Gomez Ruined Her Friendship with Francia Raisa</a></span></p><h2 id=gisele-bundchen-knew-her-boyfriend-when-she-was-married-to-tom-brady>Gisele Bundchen Knew Her Boyfriend When She Was Married To Tom Brady</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar49977391.jpg><p>Only a month after finalizing her divorce, Gisele was rumored to be dating a new man – Joaquin Valente. The pair were first romantically connected after Joaquin was <a href=#>photographed enjoying dinner with Gisele</a> and her two kids during a vacation in Costa Rica in mid-November.</p><p>Given that Joaquin is already vacationing with Gisele’s kids, it’s speculated that the two have known each other longer than a few weeks, which implies they became romantically involved before her divorce was official at the end of October.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, though the date of their divorce is known, it’s unclear when Tom and Gisele officially ended their relationship. Divorces take time, so the duo were likely over months before they were legally declared single. So, it doesn’t mean Gisele was cheating even if she began seeing Joaquin while still married on paper.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Was Britney Spears’ Miscarriage A Publicity Stunt?</a></span></p><p>For now, Gisele and Joaquin are keeping their romance relatively private. Not much is known about her new beau, who lives his life largely out of the spotlight, at least comparatively.</p><p>According to reports, Joaquin is a jiu-jitsu instructor who teaches at the Valente Brothers facility alongside his brothers, P edro Valente and Gui Valente. Joaquin reportedly began teaching in 1993, only to open up the facility five years later.</p><p>Joaquin previously attended Barry University, where he completed a bachelor’s degree in criminology. He reportedly now lives full-time in Florida, close to where Gisele is located.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, it has been confirmed that Gisele knew Joaquin before her divorce. <a href=#>The two posed for Dust Magazine</a> alongside his brothers in 2021, and Gisele <a href=#>later posted footage from a private training session taught by Joaquin.</a></p><p>“I believe the more tools we have in our toolbox the better,” Gisele captioned the post. “I feel stronger, more confidence and empowered since I started practicing self-defense. I feel it’s an important skill for all, but specially for us women.</p><p>The supermodel added, “Thank you @ValenteBrothers for being awesome teachers and making training so much fun. I am looking forward to keep improving. Let’s go!”</p><p>Tom commented on the post, writing, “My days of leaving dishes in the sink are numbered.”</p><h2 id=tom-brady-is-dating-someone-new>Tom Brady Is Dating Someone New</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom hasn’t had a negative reaction (or any reaction at all) to the news that Gisele is dating someone new. This may have something to do with the fact that he’s moved on, too.</p><p>In the past month, Tom has been linked to Slovakian model Veronika Rajek. She even attended a Tampa Buccaneers vs. Saints game in December, only to shower the quarterback with love in an Instagram post afterwards.</p><p>“I saw the LEGEND and if somebody asks me again if I love Brady, yes I love him, and show me somebody who doesn’t,” she captioned the post. “Even his haters love him because they know he is the GOAT. Tom Brady thank you for an amazing show.”</p><p>Tom and Gisele’s relationship reportedly ruptured when he unretired from the NFL in March, only weeks after announcing his retirement and a $375 million deal with Fox Sports as lead NFL analyst. Immediately, reports said that Gisele didn’t support him returning to the Buccaneers for another season. Apparently, she’d been hoping he’d focus more on family in his retirement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"<a href=#>Going back to Tampa after the retirement</a> put a strain on the personal side of his life," one source told PEOPLE. "Gisele is frustrated and sick of his career coming before their family, who has always supported him."</p><p>Tom’s new model girlfriend seems to support his career wholeheartedly, which may be what attracted the football star to the new relationship. The pair have only been linked for a few weeks, and there’s no evidence to suggest they knew each other while Tom was married.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are Kourtney Kardashian And Travis Barker Getting Their Own Reality Show?</a></span></p><h2 id=was-tom-amp-gisele-rsquo-s-divorce-amicable>Was Tom & Gisele’s Divorce Amicable?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar49886326.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though the context surrounding Tom and Gisele’s divorce appears dramatic, <a href=#>the exes are reportedly on amicable terms</a>. The divorce was quick despite each being worth hundreds of millions of dollars, thanks to an iron-clad prenup.</p><p>Reports say the exes are also committed to putting their two children first. It’s also <a href=#>likely Gisele will maintain a close relationship to her step-son</a>, who was born soon after Tom and Gisele first began dating.</p><p>Tom and Gisele may be disappointed their marriage didn’t work out, but at least the former couple appear happy in their new relationships, regardless of the continuing speculation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdnLa0scueZJutnpmwqbHNZqqtmaKperSxxKKloGWYmr9uusSwZJunqZu%2FqrHNnWSbnZakv6Z5w6KtqKqTnruoedOopGaaopaxuns%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-gisele-bundchen-start-seeing-her-new-boyfriend-before-divorcing-tom-brady.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-gisele-bundchen-start-seeing-her-new-boyfriend-before-divorcing-tom-brady.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-gisele-bundchen-start-seeing-her-new-boyfriend-before-divorcing-tom-brady.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-gisele-bundchen-start-seeing-her-new-boyfriend-before-divorcing-tom-brady.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-gisele-bundchen-start-seeing-her-new-boyfriend-before-divorcing-tom-brady.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-gisele-bundchen-start-seeing-her-new-boyfriend-before-divorcing-tom-brady.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./genshin-impact-teases-new-tcg-game-mode-pvp-content.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./genshin-impact-teases-new-tcg-game-mode-pvp-content.html>Genshin Impact teases new TCG game mode with PvP content</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./daniel-curtis-lee.html>Daniel Curtis Lee</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./daniel-curtis-lee.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
