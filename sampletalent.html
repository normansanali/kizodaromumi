Burton was born in Burbank, California, and when he was only a preteen, he began making short films in his backyard using stop motion animation techniques or film without sound. After graduating from high school, Burton began studying character animation at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, California. While studying there, Burton made some of his earliest short films including, “Stalk of the Celery Monster” and “King and Octopus.” After releasing Stalk of the Celery Monster, Burton gained attention of Walt Disney Productions and from there, he began working as an animator, storyboard artist, graphic designer, art director and concept artist for Disney films such as “The Fox and the Hound,” “Tron,” and “The Black Cauldron.” From there, Burton began working as a director for films such as “Pee-wee’s Big Adventure,” “Beetlejuice,” “Batman”, and was the director, producer, and writer for “Edward Scissorhands.” Burton has gone on to work on films such as “Batman Forever,” “James and the Giant Peach,” “Mars Attacks!,” “Sleepy Hollow,” “Planet of the Apes,” “Big Fish,” “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” “Corpse Bride,” “Alice in Wonderland,” “Dark Shadows,” “Frankenweenie,” and many more..<h2 class=tallist_profile_name>How to hire Tim Burton for an event</h2><p><b>Learn how to hire Tim Burton or research availability and pricing for booking Tim Burton to speak at a corporate event, fundraiser, private party, social media campaign, fair or festival, tradeshow or conference, endorsement project, or hire Tim Burton as a guest speaker, please submit the form to our agency.</b></p><h2 class=tallist_profile_name>Frequently Asked Questions about booking Tim Burton to speak.</h2><p>Many performers, actors, speakers and other talent like Tim Burton in certain cases will consider virtual appearances via live streaming. They perhaps may accept lower fees too. If you are seriously interested in booking Tim Burton or other talent shown on our site, we will research their desire and the specific fee for your live-streaming event or project request.</p><p>Tim Burton's current work schedule and location in relation to your event's type, date, budget, and locality will play a primary factor in the acceptance of booking Tim Burton for your party. As long as your funding is commensurate with the price range to book Tim Burton, CTI will propose your event to the official agency representing Tim Burton. After we consult with them, we will provide a personal and accurate quote that includes: final costs, availability, and actual interest in being hired for your specific event or party.</p><p>CTI can give you the accurate Tim Burton booking price once we submit your event details to their camp. "How much does it cost to book Tim Burton for an event?" is a frequent question we get. The final Tim Burton booking price is contingent on many variables and the booking fee we may show is based on a range derived from our past experience with what will Tim Burton charge for an event. An example fee to book Tim Burton is in the starting range of $150,000-$299,000. However, any recent popularity change would cause a price fluctuation well beyond this example. Also, their speaking fee might be different than the fee shown for the cost to perform or to just appear. Popularity, career stage, along with current demand will cause fluctuations in their speaking price as well. The final booking price may be more than what is shown, but you should at least have a budget within that range for them to consider an appearance, performance or speaking engagement.</p><p>There is low probability to book Tim Burton for a party with anything substantially less than the published booking cost price range. We will negotiate with the Tim Burton agent on your behalf if your funding is in place. By not having funding ready then it will more difficult to book Tim Burton, because they get many offers to work events that are at or above asking price. It is also important to consider the travel costs when researching the Tim Burton booking fee, as additional expenses like this, as well as an entourage of staff and equipment, are not necessarily built-in to the booking fee range shown. If your budget does not factor that in, then there is no benefit for them to want to be hired. We do not personally speak for Tim Burton, but in our experience in booking talent for over 25 years, this is generally the outcome of inadequate funding.</p><p><b>Type</b><br>Speaker</p><p><b>Speaking Topic</b><br>Film-TV</p><p><b>Range</b><br>Film-TV, Media, Male, Age Group-18-30's, Age Group-All Ages, Age Group-60's+, Age Group-30's-50's</p><b>Bookmark and Share</b><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaK4xKerZ6aVqXy0rcypo56skaGyr8COa2dxb2Rkwaq5jJusq6yfo3w%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./list-of-universities-in-imo-state.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./list-of-universities-in-imo-state.html>List of Universities in Imo State</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./frank-simes.html>Frank Simes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./frank-simes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
