Unlike his fellow newbie, <a href=#>Jesse Solomon</a>, West honed in on only one woman romantically — <a href=#>Ciara Miller</a>. Their interactions were immediately flirtatious, and soon enough they were smooching and snuggling regularly. They had their first sleepover in a tent, and it’s clear that they really liked each other, but are <a href=#>Ciara and West</a> still together?</p><p>Issues of love were at the forefront of Summer House Season 8. Lindsay Hubbard and Carl Radke’s impending nuptials were overshadowed by their constant fighting. The amount of vitriol from their fights had several other members of the house feeling like they shouldn’t get married at all. <a href=#>Kyle Cooke</a> and <a href=#>Amanda Batula</a> also had issues in their marriage, and Paige DeSorbo approached her relationship with <a href=#>Craig Conover</a> with too much caution.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Are Ciara and West from ‘Summer House’ still together?</h2><p>West recently made an appearance on <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live!</a>, where he was naturally asked about the status of his relationship with Ciara. He played coy, saying that viewers would need to keep watching to see what happens to their romance. However, he did drop a little hint thanks to a fan noticing something in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">selfie Ciara</a> posted after filming. The selfie indicated that Ciara was in West’s home state of Missouri, which he didn't deny.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Ciara and West’s simmering romance brought much needed wholesomeness to Season 8.</h2><p>West’s endearing personality made him seem well-suited for Ciara. He wasn't interested in drama and being surrounded by it. West also wasn't interested in getting to know <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">anyone else</a> romantically. He listened to Ciara and didn't try to push her into doing anything too fast. Things seemed to be headed in a good direction for the couple, despite Ciara’s fears following her previous relationships.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Ciara had rough relationships in the past.</h2><p>Ciara spoke briefly with West about her past relationship struggles. The guy she dated before West left her feeling hurt and humiliated. She dated fellow <a href=#>Winter House</a> star <a href=#>Austen Kroll</a>, and their romance was featured heavily in the first season. Things ended dramatically when Austen decided to make out with Lindsay at her birthday party. Despite the embarrassment, Ciara was able to get closure with Austen, but the experience made her wary of dating another cast member.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">A visit to the family farm could mean love is still in the air for Ciara and West.</h2><p>The eagle-eyed Summer House fan who discovered Ciara’s post-filming selfie asked about it when West was on WWHL. In the photo, Ciara was wearing West’s hat, and it was clear that she was on a farm somewhere. He came clean, saying that she did visit his family’s farm and that his parents “love her.” In paying attention to semantics, his use of the word “love” and not “loved” implies that they still love her, which hopefully means that they’re still together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2BmecKimKuZXZa7pXnWnqqtZaOptq24jK2moJ2knbKzedKupKadomK1sMHSng%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-ciara-and-west-still-together-summer-house.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fare-ciara-and-west-still-together-summer-house.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fare-ciara-and-west-still-together-summer-house.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fare-ciara-and-west-still-together-summer-house.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-ciara-and-west-still-together-summer-house.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-ciara-and-west-still-together-summer-house.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lyrics-brakence-blind-spot.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lyrics-brakence-blind-spot.html>Brakence blind spot lyrics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./annoyingtv.html>AnnoyingTV- Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Ethnicity</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./annoyingtv.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
