The main cast had terrific chemistry, while the show was on top of the TV world for ten seasons.</p><p>Despite the closeness of the cast, they were all very easy to work with, particularly <strong><a href=#>Matthew Perry</a></strong>. According to several guest stars, the actor was a class act and always made guest stars feel at home during their time on the show.</p><p>In the following, we'll reveal several examples of Perry treating guest stars with respect. In addition, we'll take a look at the classy way Matthew Perry helped out a guest star after he received no reaction from the live audience.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The One Friends Question Matthew Perry Told An Interviewer To Stop Asking During Their Candid Conversation</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-stamos-felt-awful-about-his-friends-reception-but-matthew-perry-made-sure-he-got-an-applause-from-the-audience>John Stamos Felt Awful About His Friends Reception, But Matthew Perry Made Sure He Got An Applause From The Audience</h2><p>Friends had several memorable guest stars. John Stamos was yet another major name to appear on the show. However, his one episode appearance flew under the radar. Stamos shared some details as to what took place during his cameo. He shared <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a touching memory of Matthew Perry </a>during his time on Friends.</p><p>According to Stamos, Perry was supporting him prior to his first scene. However, the reaction wasn't what either Perry or Stamos were anticipating.</p><p>Stamos revealed, “Matthew and I had been friendly long before Friends. So, when I guest stared as Zach, the prospective sperm donor for Chandler and Monica, I hung with him a lot,” Stamos shared. “Standing backstage, ready to make my entrance, Matt whispers, ‘The audience is going go crazy when they see you! Get ready for some loud screams.'”</p><p>He continues, “I walk through the door… silence.

However, Matthew Perry made sure that Stamos didn't leave the set without getting a proper reaction.</p><p>"We finish the scene and as I start to slither back to my dressing room and quit showbiz, Matt walks over to the studio audience: ‘Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for John Stamos! You guys probably didn’t recognize him at first because he’s so much better looking in person!’ I never forgot that and the world will never forget you.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perry wanted to ensure that Stamos left the show on a positive note.

Perhaps one of his biggest contributions was getting Bruce Willis on the show. However, he was also very generous to other guest stars, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perry once gave Aisha Tyler a pep talk during her first day on Friends.</a></p><p>Tyler recalled the moment, calling it very special. "The night of my very first live performance in front of a studio audience, as the cast came together at the end of the taping to take a bow in front of the crowd, Matthew Perry made a point of saying to me, "Get ready for your life to change," and it did!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instar51816121.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continues, "He may have said that to every guest actor, I don't know, but it was a special moment for me, and a seminal memory of my time there."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Friends Storyline Matthew Perry Stepped In And Banned From The Show</a></span></p><p>Tyler had high praise for her experience in general as well, alongside the talented cast.</p><p>"The cast was incredibly welcoming when I first joined."</p><p>"This was in season 9 when they had already had several very high-profile guest actors on the show, including Brad Pitt, Reese Witherspoon, Tom Selleck, and Bruce Willis.

Brewster would go on to reveal that Perry was the reason she got the role, given that he was in the audition room.</p><p>"I actually owe Matthew Perry my career," she beams. "He was in the casting room when I got that and I guess he went to bat for me and said, 'She's the funniest one; you have to cast her.'"</p><p>Brewster had a blast during her time on Friends, and in fact, she wasn't ready to leave the show despite the breakup with Chandler during the sitcom.</p><p>Nonetheless, she was appreciative of her time on the show and the help she was able to get from Matthew Perry along the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqyknbK4ec%2BeqauxXayyr8CMqKytZZ%2Bbeqm10maumrFdqbxutMSlp2ain527br%2FTmqSoq12ku26y0aKcp5yjYq6nwMSrZK2glWKws7vWnWSgmaaaeqm1zGaYZqifpL9uvsSamq2hn6N8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmatthew-perry-went-out-of-his-way-to-help-john-stamos-on-friends-after-the-crowd-gave-him-a-poor-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmatthew-perry-went-out-of-his-way-to-help-john-stamos-on-friends-after-the-crowd-gave-him-a-poor-reaction.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmatthew-perry-went-out-of-his-way-to-help-john-stamos-on-friends-after-the-crowd-gave-him-a-poor-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmatthew-perry-went-out-of-his-way-to-help-john-stamos-on-friends-after-the-crowd-gave-him-a-poor-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmatthew-perry-went-out-of-his-way-to-help-john-stamos-on-friends-after-the-crowd-gave-him-a-poor-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmatthew-perry-went-out-of-his-way-to-help-john-stamos-on-friends-after-the-crowd-gave-him-a-poor-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./meet-adam-sandlers-family-jackie-sadie-sunny-and-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./meet-adam-sandlers-family-jackie-sadie-sunny-and-more.html>Meet Adam Sandlers Family: Jackie, Sadie, Sunny and More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kaitlyn-dever-mourns-mom-kathys-death-after-cancer-battle.html>Kaitlyn Dever Mourns Mom Kathy's Death After Cancer Battle</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kaitlyn-dever-mourns-mom-kathys-death-after-cancer-battle.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
