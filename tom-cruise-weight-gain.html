He is one of Hollywood's highest-paid performers, having starred in the comedy Risky Business (1983) and the action-thriller Top Gun (1986).</p><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=4 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>The actor has garnered numerous awards, including an Honorary Palme d'Or and three Golden Globe nominations, as well as three Academy Award nominations and a British Academy Film Award nomination.</p><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=5 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>For his role as a motivational speaker in the drama Magnolia (1999), Cruise won another Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Since then, he has primarily acted in science fiction and action films, cementing his reputation as an action star who frequently performs his dangerous stunts.</p><p data-paragraphid=5 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>Tom Cruise is a vocal supporter of Scientology, which he credits with helping him overcome dyslexia. His Scientology-affiliated criticisms of psychiatry and anti-depressant medicine, his efforts to promote Scientology in Europe, and a leaked video interview of him supporting Scientology created controversy in the 2000s.</p><p data-paragraphid=5 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>Tom's latest movie, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Top Gun: Maverick</strong></a>, was released on May 27 2022 and fans have noticed that he looks a little heavy than in his previous movie. As a result, they seek more details about his transformation. Well here is everything we know about Tom Cruise's <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>weight gain</strong></a> journey.</p><p data-paragraphid=5 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>Previously, we touched on the&nbsp;weight gain efforts of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Dave Bautista</strong></a> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Adriana Lima</a>. </strong>Additionally, have a glance at <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jennifer Connelly's plastic surgery</strong></a>.</p><h2>Tom Cruise’s Weight Gain: The Top Gun Actor’s Swollen face Grabbed the Attention of His Fans!</h2><p><strong>Tom Cruise</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@tomcruise</a>) has managed to surprise everyone with his massive weight gain. His internet weight gain speculations are practically unavoidable right now.</p><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=3 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>Tom, who rarely appears in public, went to a Dodgers game with his son <strong>Connor</strong> this weekend, and his face was noticeably broader. Tom Cruise and his son Connor (<a href=# rel=noopener>@theconnorcruise</a>) recently attended a baseball game, but it was his swollen face that grabbed the attention of his fans, not the relatively uncommon sight of a father and son together.</p><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=5 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>Tom Cruise's admirers couldn't get enough of the actor's new look and joke about his weight gain on Twitter with memes, jokes, and even encouraging remarks. With the release of Top Gun in 1996, his career reached dizzying heights, and the then-24-year-old still had much of his boyish charm and thin face.</p><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=4 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>While some admirers speculated that he had acquired weight for a film part, others simply laughed it off and wished the actor to be himself. The Mission Impossible star and his son Connor were photographed at Oracle Park, watching the San Francisco Giants play the Los Angeles Dodgers in a baseball game.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=4>Tom Cruise was seen trading fist bumps with fans, laughing with attendees, and beaming broadly when he was seen on the stadium's large screens in photos and videos released online. One Twitter user wondered,</p><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=3 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>"What's up with the bloated chipmunk cheeks? @TomCruise What have you done with your lovely features?! When I spotted you in the stands during the Dodgers game, I was very disappointed! Another user responded, Stop shoving garbage in your face!"</p><p data-paragraphid=4 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>Also, his uneven dentition, which saw one front tooth aligned with the center of his face, drew criticism from admirers. Tom's face was beginning to shift, and he appeared chubbier on occasion, probably as a result of weight fluctuations. However, Tom is yet to make any comments regarding his weight gain and swollen face.</p><h2 data-paragraphid=4 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>Tom Cruise’s Children: The Actor Is the Father of Three Kids!</h2><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=3 data-from-init=true data-changed=false><strong>Tom Cruise</strong> has been married to <strong>Mimi Rogers</strong>, <strong>Nicole Kidman</strong>, and <strong>Katie Holmes</strong>, all of whom are actresses. For Tom Cruise's children, he is just their father and there is no higher role than that.</p><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=5 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>The Top Gun <a href=# rel=noopener>star </a>is the father of three children. With his ex-wife, Nicole Kidman, he has one son, <strong>Connor Cruise</strong>, and an elder daughter, <strong>Isabella Bella</strong> <strong>Cruise </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@bellakidmancurise</a>). When the Golden Globe winner and Big Little Lies star married, they adopted Bella and Connor. Cruise, on the other hand, has one biological child, <strong>Suri</strong>, whom he shares with his second ex-wife, Katie Holmes.</p><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=3 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>Fans have often questioned if Tom Cruise's children visit him much and how their relationship is today. The actor is well-known for keeping his life secret, but that doesn't mean there isn't any information about Tom Cruise's children to reveal.</p><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=3 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>Tom Cruise's youngest child is Suri.&nbsp;Suri and her father's last known images, according to Hollywood Life, were taken nearly a decade ago in 2012 when the two visited Disneyland together. Despite their separated relationship, Tom still loves Suri.</p><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=5 data-from-init=true data-changed=false><strong>Connor Cruise</strong>, Tom Cruise's only child, was born in January 1995. Shortly after Connor's birth, the Risky Business star and his then-wife, Nicole Kidman, adopted him. Connor is currently residing in Florida and works as a DJ.</p><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=6 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>Tom Cruise's eldest kid is <strong>Isabella Bella Cruise</strong>. Cruise and his then-wife, Nicole Kidman, adopted Bella during their ten-year marriage, which ended in 2001. Bella, like her father, is a notoriously private individual. She now lives in London, where she works as an artist and has her own business.</p><p data-paragraphid=6 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>Before you leave, check out <a href=#><strong>if Tom Cruise has received a nose job</strong></a> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Val Kilmer's cosmetic changes</a></strong>.</p><p data-paragraphid=6 data-from-init=true data-changed=false><strong>Visit&nbsp;<a href=#>House & Whips</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;<a href=#>interesting stories</a>&nbsp;about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGirqKVdmL%2B2tdKeZLCdmZy1tXnGmqCnZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftom-cruise-weight-gain.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftom-cruise-weight-gain.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftom-cruise-weight-gain.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftom-cruise-weight-gain.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftom-cruise-weight-gain.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftom-cruise-weight-gain.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-is-the-sales-tax-in-temecula-ca-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-is-the-sales-tax-in-temecula-ca-html.html>What is the sales tax in Temecula CA?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-plays-jj-in-outer-banks.html>The Actor Who Plays JJ in 'Outer Banks' Ditched Culinary School to Find Himself</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-plays-jj-in-outer-banks.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
