Chris played an instrumental role to look for his missing fugitive son. However, he faced criticism for not cooperating to help find his son’s fiance. Let’s learn a few more things about him.</p><p>We bring you Chris Laundrie Bio that covers his age, his job, and his social media details.</p><h3><strong>Meet Chris Laundrie, Brian Laundrie’s Dad</strong></h3><p>The family attorney of Brian Laundrie revealed that Brian died by suicide. His parents were informed that the cause of his death was a gunshot wound to the head and the manner of death was suicide which was released on 23 November 2021. His parents were mourning the loss of Brian’s life. The attorney also revealed that finding him brought closure to his parents.</p><p>Brian’s skeletal remains were found on 20 October 2021 at the Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park. Professor of Forensic studies David Thomas, Ph.D. shared that Laundrie’s body likely decomposed quickly due to the heat and humidity in Florida.</p><p>In amidst search for Brian, Chris Laundrie, his father had put of no trespassing sign. In mid-October 2021, Brian’s father emerged from his Florida home Saturday to remove a sign protesters left on his lawn next to a large photo of Gabby Petito, pictures showed. He was also spotted ripping down a yellow sign reading “What if this happened to Cassie?,” a reference to his daughter and Brian’s sister.</p><p>In early October, Chris said that he would leave his North Port house and join the manhunt for his son. Three weeks into the search for his fugitive son, Chris started actively helping in the effort to find his son Brian. He went to the nature park for a few hours at the request of investigators according to the Laundrie family attorney, so he could point search crews toward Brian’s favorite spots to hike and camp.</p><p>Laundrie’s family attorney had revealed that Brian left the home of his parents in his silver Ford Mustang on 14 Sept and that Brian’s parents retrieved the Mustang from a parking area at Carlton Reserve on 16 September. The family had remained silent while the investigators searched the 25,000-acre reserve for their son.</p><p>Right after the disappearance of Gabby Petito, Brian’s family avoided co-operating with Gabby’s parents to help find her.</p><p>In Mid October FBI Tampa revealed that they have found partial human remains at the Carlton Reserve but were not identified, initially. They also recovered Laundrie’s backpack and notebook. The family attorney revealed Brian’s father found a bag containing some of Brian’s items, and officers found the backpack on the other side of the trail which was near the remains.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Chris Laundrie Wife?</strong></h3><p>Chris Laundrie married Brian’s mother <a href=#>Roberta Laundrie</a> (age 55).

Brian’s parents surrendered their firearms to law enforcement the same day they informed authorities that their son<strong>&nbsp;</strong>was missing. The comment from the family attorney came days after the forensic report confirmed that it was Laundrie’s remains that they discovered and he died by suicide.</p><p>As reported. Chris and Roberta surrendered their gun on 17 September after they discovered one handgun was not in its case. Attorney revealed that The FBI and North Port, Florida, police were present at the time of the discovery. Because of the “frenzied atmosphere at the time” the authority kept that piece of information a secret from the public.</p><p>Before Chris agreed to help with the search, he and his wife holed up in their Florida home.</p><p>The Laundries revealed that Brian’s “very upset” behavior before he left his house. Chris could not stop him from leaving and felt helpless, according to a family lawyer.
