She has retained a lawyer and insists that the viral video, which has garnered over 40 million views on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Twitter</strong></a>, has been taken out of context.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>But let’s stick to the facts for now, i.e. what we can see with our own eyes and the details that have emerged since, starting with what actually happened in the video.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-in-the-viral-video data-injectable=false>What happened in the viral video?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>This lady tried her best to weaponize her tears, but when she realized it wasn't going to work she switched it off and acted like nothing happened.</p><p>This should be criminal. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/P1UW3gJZGf</a></p>— 🥀Imposter🥀 (@Imposter_Edits) <a href=#>May 14, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>The viral video begins in the middle of a verbal altercation. Comrie is seen straddling a public Citi Bike dressed in scrubs while the young men around her urge the person holding the camera to “record her, record her.” Comrie, as you can see, is shouting for help.&nbsp;</p><p>“Help! Help me! Please help me! Please help me! Please help me, help! Please got off me. Please get off.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true>Throughout the duration of her cries, the group of young men repeatedly tell Comrie that the bike is not hers and that they have already paid for it. “This is not your bike,” the young man closest to her says. “This is not your bike. What the f*** is going on? You know you’re not getting the bike. You’re not getting the bike.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>Here is where things escalate, as Comrie then snatches the young man’s phone out of his hand, clearly not in the correct state of mind to comprehend that her phone is already poking out of the breast pocket of her scrubs.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>“You’re hurting my fetus,” Comrie says to the young man, to which he replies “I’m not touching you. You’re putting your stomach on my hand.” His hand is indeed latched onto the bike’s center console, which Comrie’s stomach rubs up against repeatedly, although the young man never moves his hand and he does not press or shove Comrie away.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=497 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true>After half a minute of shouting for help a stranger appears behind the group asking what is going on; he, too, is dressed in scrubs. Here, Comrie immediately bursts into tears, crumbling over on herself and dropping her face into her hand. When the stranger asks why the group of young men doesn’t just reset the bike, the young man who was next to Comrie can be heard saying “This is my bike, it’s on my account. Please move… I’m not resetting the bike… It’s on my account.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>Realizing the young men don’t intend to let up and that there is a perfectly good bike next to them, the stranger asks Comrie why she doesn’t just take that one. Here, those tears Comrie tried to exert immediately vanish and she steps away from the bike with a perfectly composed face.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-was-the-public-reaction-to-the-video data-injectable=false>What was the public reaction to the video?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>She tried taking a CitiBike that already paid for on his account.

This is EXACTLY the type of behavior that has endangered so many Black men in the past!”</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>All in all, the overall consensus was one of condemnation and disgust.

Initially reported by <a href=#>New York Post</a> and corroborated by The Independent, receipts from the altercation reportedly show Comrie’s Citi Bike account attached to the serial number of the bike in question. According to <a href=#>The Independent</a>, “the receipts capture Ms. Comrie checking out the bike, then docking it a minute later, without paying a charge.”&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-was-the-backlash-against-citi-bike-karen-warranted data-injectable=false>Was the backlash against “Citi Bike Karen” warranted?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is so sad!

As it turns out, Comrie did reportedly pay for the bike, and the people who called her a Karen have been dragged over the coals for jumping to conclusions.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Please donate to the GoFundMe of Sarah Comrie, the pregnant nurse who was attacked and robbed of her Citibike by 5 black males, then accused of being a "racist Karen!"

Or, at least, that is the opinion of this writer.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=881 data-injectable=true>With all that said, it is hard to ignore Comrie’s behavior in the viral video. Facts or not, her reaction is — as her employer pointed out upon her suspension — “disturbing.” There’s no way to know for sure whether she would’ve acted the same had she been surrounded by young white men instead young Black men. Would she have felt the need to shout for help as though her life were in danger? Would she have resorted to tears at the sight of the nearest friendly (white) face?&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>Racism is a charged word, one that can immediately rub someone the wrong way. But it’s not nearly as dangerous as the violent acts committed against Black people and other persons of color; acts that have a historical precedent of being spawned from situations such as these, in which one white lady is not only given the benefit of the doubt against her Black aggressor, but then used as a vehicle for retribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>Like the underlying issue at hand, the opinions about the “Citi Bike Karen” incident are split, with parts of the population using the revelation of Comrie’s receipts as proof of counter-racism and trigger-happy “cancel culture,” while other parts of the population can’t erase from their minds the image of a white woman crying for help from Black men who are quite literally standing still and doing nothing to harm her.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Citi Bike Karen's new defense is that she has proof (that she isn't willing to release to the press) that she rented the bike.
