The Wu-Tang Clan was first formed in 1992 and consisted of three cousins, the de facto leader and producer of the group RZA, and his partners in crime, GZA, and Ol' Dirty B*stard. Beyond those three, the group further fleshed out its membership with Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Method Man, U-God, Masta Killa, and Inspectah Deck. Upon their debut in the early '90s, RZA's original production style would revolutionize all hip-hop. By changing the speed and pitch of the samples he'd use, RZA created an industry staple that would be utilized in the years to come by other legends in the game like Jay-Z and <a href=#>Kanye West</a>, along with a slew of others. Now many fans wonder: <a href=#>What happened to The Wu-Tang Clan?</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their first studio album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), despite having a decidedly Lo-Fi underground quality to its mix, would peak at number 41 on the US Billboard 200 upon release. The album went platinum two years later, and their single C.R.E.A.M. went gold. But aside from their sound, <a href=#>what really made Wu-Tang special was their business model, which allowed them to make a fortune</a>. They managed to negotiate an ambitious record deal with Loud Records that allowed the group's members the freedom to sign solo deals with other record labels while still taking the Wu-Tang branding. Here's why they couldn't get along.</p><h2 id=why-was-wu-tang-clan-so-popular>Why Was Wu-Tang Clan So Popular?</h2><p>These nine talented MCs were able to branch out and further the Wu-Tang brand on their own. By working this way, the group grew their affiliation to include as many as 300 of what they call Wu-Tang Killa Beez. By fleshing out their ranks with affiliates in this way, the Clan became omnipresent, able to appear everywhere, building an enormous body of work with an exposure level that few other artists could rival.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Super Bowl Struggled To Do A Full Hip-Hop Half Time Show</a></span></p><p>By 1995, the group was such a cultural touchstone that they were able to turn their cult following into a thriving fashion label known as Wu Wear, a clothing line that was picked up by many major retailers. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Their stylized golden "w" became one of the most recognizable logos in all music</a>. Their branding appeared not only on clothing but also on other pop culture areas like skateboards, video games, and even action figures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-the-wu-tang-clan-break-up>Why Did The Wu-Tang Clan Break Up?</h2><p>The group didn't break up as much as its members, mostly switching to pursue solo careers. In 1997, Wu-Tang dropped their second album Wu-Tang Forever after the band had spent the four years between albums establishing their solo careers. When this second studio album hit, it immediately shot to the top of the Billboard charts, debuting in the number one spot. That year also saw the first appearance of the man who would become the group's unofficial tenth member, Cappadonna, on the single Triumph. Cappadonna would pop in Wu-Tang songs on and off over the years, and his status as an official member was always something of a sticking point with fans. But in 2014, RZA would definitively call Cappadonna an official member of the Clan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ol-39-dirty-b-stard-39-s-death-deeply-affected-the-wu-tang-clan>Ol' Dirty B*stard's Death Deeply Affected The Wu-Tang Clan</h2><p>After the release of Wu-Tang Forever came another batch of solo projects, but, by now, the group was finally beginning to suffer from overexposure. Their third studio album, The W, still sold like hotcakes upon its release in 2000. However, by their following release in 2001, Iron Flag sales dipped.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is The Richest Star Of 'Growing Up Hip Hop'</a></span></p><p>Beyond their declining popularity, managing a group of so many different personalities began to become increasingly difficult. Interpersonal conflicts started to arise when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ol' Dirty B*stard collapsed in the Clan's studio and passed away from an accidental overdose</a>. As a result, the group began to fall apart at the seams.</p><h2 id=are-the-wu-tang-clan-still-friends>Are The Wu-Tang Clan Still Friends?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wu-Tang Clan would hit the pause button from 2001 to 2007</a>. When they reassembled, their fifth studio album, 8 Diagrams, was released, which included collaborations from the likes of John Frusciante from Red Hot Chili Peppers and Shavo Odadjian from System of a Down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The sound of this record was decidedly different from their earlier Lo-Fi days, but it would still debut at number 25 on the Billboard 200 and number 9 on the R&B/Hip-Hop charts. Following that release would come yet another seven-year break, but the group would once more reconvene. This time in 2013, to hit the festival circuit in celebration of the 20 years since they first formed.</p><p>They dropped their sixth studio album, A Better Tomorrow, in 2014, which went on to debut at number 29 on the Billboard 200. With neither of their most recent albums selling well to qualify for gold status or platinum, Wu-Tang decided to work on what would turn into their seventh and most monumental album release. The group envisioned 2015's Once Upon a Time in Shaolin as a single sale collector's item. The group would only impress one copy of this album and then sell it for $2 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Wu-Tang Clan has undeniably had its ups and downs as a collective over the years. Nevertheless, they're also one of the few groups who can say their solo success never interferes with their ability to reconvene its collectiveness. Despite their differences, the members know Wu-Tang will always be stronger together.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Is Hip-Hop Artist SosMula?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqbWmedauZK2Znpx6pLjAp2SmnZ2XsrO%2FjJymrqSUo8Fus8StZJqkn6O0cA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-the-wu-tang-clan-members-couldnt-get-along.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-the-wu-tang-clan-members-couldnt-get-along.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-the-wu-tang-clan-members-couldnt-get-along.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-the-wu-tang-clan-members-couldnt-get-along.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-the-wu-tang-clan-members-couldnt-get-along.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-the-wu-tang-clan-members-couldnt-get-along.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cosmetic-surgery-history.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cosmetic-surgery-history.html>A Brief History Of Cosmetic Surgery</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-did-howard-schnellenberger-leave-louisville.html>Why did Howard Schnellenberger leave Louisville?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-did-howard-schnellenberger-leave-louisville.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
