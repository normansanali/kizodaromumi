He began as a teen dreamboat, shining in moody dramas like River’s Edge, then hammed it up in the Bill & Ted movies.

To commemorate Reeves returning to the role of Theodore “Ted” Logan in Bill & Ted Face the Music, here is the accumulated legend of Keanu, gleaned from 30 years of (sometimes glowing, sometimes condescending) press coverage.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckdyyscyz00453h682u0ia37x@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>His Early Years</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckdyytcv5004b3h68fviytihu@published data-word-count=111>Keanu Charles Reeves was born on September 2, 1964, in Beirut, Lebanon, to Patricia Taylor, a casino showgirl from England, and her husband, Samuel Reeves Jr., vagabond son of a prominent Hawaiian family.
