However, her family history and her parents’ ethnicity are a little more complicated.</p><p>Martin and Nanette Bledel, her parents, have different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Although her mother was raised in Mexico, she was born in the United States. She thus had a Latino background and environment while growing up. Her father, on the other hand, was born in Argentina.</p><p>In addition, her mother is Mexican, and her father is Danish and German. Bledel’s paternal grandpa was Enrique Einar Bledel Huus, vice president of Coca-Cola Latin America, and her grandmother Jean was of Scottish and English descent, going back another generation.</p><p>She considered herself a Latina and was raised in a Spanish-speaking home; she did not learn English until she started school.</p><p><strong>Also Read</strong>;&nbsp;Who Is Eve Palmer?

When she was eight, Bledel’s mother relocated to Mexico City.</p><p>“It’s the only culture my mother knows from life, and my father as well,” Bledel has said of her parents’ upbringing in Latin America. “They decided to raise their children within the framework they had been reared in.”</p><p>Bledel attended Baptist and Lutheran schools until earning his diploma in 1999 from Houston’s Catholic St. Agnes Academy. To get over her nervousness, her mother suggested she attend community theater.</p><p>She performed in youth-oriented versions of Our Town and The Wizard of Oz. She was hired as a fashion model after being discovered at a nearby mall.</p><p>The WB comedy-drama Gilmore Girls, which aired for seven seasons from October 5, 2000, to May 15, 2007, starred Bledel opposite, Lauren Graham.
