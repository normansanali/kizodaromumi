He was born on December 20, 1980, in Stepney, London.</strong></p><p>Ashley Cole is widely regarded as one of the best left-backs of his generation, and his career spanned over 20 years, during which he won numerous trophies and individual accolades.</p><p>Ashley Cole began his footballing journey at the age of nine, when he joined the Arsenal Youth Academy. He quickly made his way through the ranks and made his first-team debut for the Gunners in November 1999, at the age of just 18. Cole was initially used as a left-sided midfielder, but he soon established himself as a left-back due to his pace, stamina, and defensive qualities.</p><p>Over the next few years, Cole became a regular for Arsenal, helping the team win the Premier League twice, as well as the FA Cup on three occasions. He was also part of the famous Arsenal ‘Invincibles’ team that went unbeaten in the league during the 2003-04 season. Cole’s performances for Arsenal earned him international recognition, and he made his debut for the England national team in 2001.</p><p>Despite his success with Arsenal, Ashley Cole’s time at the club was marred by controversy when he was fined by the Premier League for his part in an illegal approach from Chelsea. Cole was eventually allowed to leave Arsenal in 2006, and he signed for Chelsea in a deal worth around £5 million.</p><p>Cole quickly established himself as a key player for Chelsea, helping the team win the Premier League in his first season at the club. He continued to be a regular for the Blues over the next few years, winning a number of domestic trophies, including four FA Cups and another Premier League title.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Cole</a> was also an important player for the England national team during this period. He was part of the squad that reached the quarter-finals of the 2006 World Cup, and he played a key role in England’s qualification for the 2010 World Cup. At the tournament in South Africa, Cole was one of England’s best performers, helping the team reach the last 16 before they were knocked out by Germany.</p><p>After a successful eight-year spell at Chelsea, Cole left the club in 2014 and joined Italian side Roma on a two-year deal. He made 11 appearances for Roma before moving to the United States to join LA Galaxy in 2016. Cole played for LA Galaxy for three seasons before retiring from professional football in 2019.</p><p>Off the field, Cole’s personal life has been the subject of media attention over the years. He was married to pop star Cheryl Tweedy from 2006 to 2010, and he has also been involved in several high-profile legal cases, including a 2008 incident where he accidentally shot a work experience student with an air rifle at Chelsea’s training ground.</p><p>Despite the controversies and off-field distractions, Cole will be remembered as one of the greatest left-backs of his generation. His speed, defensive qualities, and ability to get forward and contribute to the attack made him a valuable asset to any team he played for. Cole won numerous trophies throughout his career, including three Premier League titles, seven FA Cups, and one UEFA Champions League trophy. He was also named in the PFA Team of the Year on six occasions and was voted England Player of the Year in 2010.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meet Ashley Cole’s Children</h2><p>Ashley Cole, the former English professional footballer, has two children.</p><p>His first child, a son named Christopher, was born to his former girlfriend, Denise Richards, in 2009.

Canu is an Italian model and the couple has been together since 2014. They have kept their relationship and family life mostly private, but Cole has shared a few photos of his sons on social media.</p><p>Overall, Ashley Cole has two sons from two different relationships. While he has been relatively private about his family life, he seems to be devoted to his children and has shared some touching moments with them on social media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqacnqxdlsCpuMSyZJynnJrAbq%2FHoqOdqpWjfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-ashley-coles-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeet-ashley-coles-children.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeet-ashley-coles-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeet-ashley-coles-children.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-ashley-coles-children.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-ashley-coles-children.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./megan-rapinoes-pink-hair-color-how-to.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./megan-rapinoes-pink-hair-color-how-to.html>Megan Rapinoe's Pink Hair Color How-to</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./maurii-davenport.html>Maurii Davenport</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./maurii-davenport.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
