<time>18 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Greta-Weems.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>HGTV’s Home Town, which features the married couple Ben and Erin Napier put their renovating and designing skills to restore homes in Mississippi, has already run for five seasons now. Besides Ben and Erin, the show also features many other contractors and cast.</p><p>One of the fan-favorites of the show was Mike Husers aka ‘the floor guy.’ Since Mike has not appeared on the HGTV show since last year, fans of the show have been wondering about <a href=#>Mike Husers</a> and his family, which includes his wife Greta Weems and kids.</p><p>In this article, we will of course talk about why Mike has not been appearing on Home Town since last year and what we think he is up to now. But, more than that, this wiki-article will be about Mike Huser’s spouse, Greta Weems, her age, job, and other general stuff.</p><h3><strong>Meet Greta Weems, Mike Husers Spouse</strong></h3><p>Mike Husers aka ‘the floor guy’ is an OG in the world of home improvement and was one of the fan-favorites on the show Home Improvement. So, it’s only natural that the viewers are worried about Mike given that he has not appeared on the show since last year.</p><p>We believe, A Go Fund Me page created by his wife Erin might be able to explain Mike’s absence from the show. According to the page, Mike had an impending surgery to fix his hip injury, caused by crouching and standing for years. Erin also wrote, “Walking and working are becoming increasingly difficult so let’s show Mike we love him and make his surgery cost and the 8-week recovery away from work (which will be harder for him to walk away from than the recovery itself) a little easier. Thanks far and wide to his many fans!” in the description.</p><p>With over 600 donations coming from different people, Erin was successful to raise a total of $19 thousand from the fundraiser. While Mike might have already gotten hip surgery, there’s another reason why Mike is still missing from the show Home Town.</p><p>On January 26, 2022, Ben’s wife Erin took to Twitter to explain Mike’s absence from the show. She wrote, “He’s on a leave of absence caring for a family member with a long-term illness.”</p><p>Therefore, if everything goes well, viewers might see ‘the floor guy’ again in Home Town, hopefully in the 6th season itself.</p><h3><strong>How Many Kids Do Greta Weems And Mike Husers Have?</strong></h3><p>According to Mike’s Instagram, it looks like he is spending a lot of time with his wife, family members, or fishing. On January 5, 2022, Mike posted a picture of Greta on his Instagram (@gmhardwood) and wrote, “She makes it all look so easy.”</p><p>While we don’t the exact amount of kids Greta and Mike have, we can safely say that they at least have one grown-up daughter. Mike posted some pictures with his wife and his daughter on Facebook in 2016.</p><p>Greta and Mike’s daughter seems to be already married and also has one daughter of her own. Mike posted a picture with his granddaughter on January 30, 2021, wishing the little one a happy 7th birthday and also thanked her for making him a granddad.</p><h3><strong>Greta Weems Age</strong></h3><p>Born on June 10, 1970, Greta Weems was 51 years of age in February 2022. On the other hand, her husband Mike was 55 years of age in 2022.</p><h3><strong>Greta Weems Job</strong></h3><p>As we all know, Greta’s husband, Mike owns and runs GM Hardwood Floors, a family business of over 20 years, which specializes in hardwood flooring.</p><p>According to the company’s description, GM Hardwood Floors is “a family-owned and operated business dedicated to providing its customers with the highest quality of craftsmanship in the restoration, maintenance, and addition of hardwood flooring in homes and businesses.”</p><p>Talking about Greta’s job, she also works at GM Hardwood Floors as a member. As of this writing, we are unsure of what is Greta’s role in the business.</p><p>Also, Greta has never made any appearances on HGTV’s Home Town.</p><h3><strong>Is Greta Weems On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Unfortunately, Greta Weems is not on Instagram or any other social media platform. However, you can find her husband Mike Husers on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.</p><p>Out of all three platforms, he is most active on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. As of this writing, he had only 8.6 thousand followers on his account.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Greta Weems From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Greta Weems is from Laurel, Mississippi.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Does Greta Weems Appear On HGTV’s “Home Town”?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>As said earlier, Greta Weems has never appeared on HGVT’s “Home Town” even though her husband was a series regular until a year ago.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmoKqVqa5uw8SepKxlkp68bq3GnmSjp5JitbC5xGarqK%2BeYrqqt8Rmn66rlafAbr%2FPqKysnV8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgreta-weems-bio-age-job-home-town-mike-husers-spouse.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgreta-weems-bio-age-job-home-town-mike-husers-spouse.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgreta-weems-bio-age-job-home-town-mike-husers-spouse.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgreta-weems-bio-age-job-home-town-mike-husers-spouse.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgreta-weems-bio-age-job-home-town-mike-husers-spouse.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgreta-weems-bio-age-job-home-town-mike-husers-spouse.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-was-whitney-houston-married-to-husband-and-relationship.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-was-whitney-houston-married-to-husband-and-relationship.html>Who Was Whitney Houston Married To | Husband And Relationship</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./when-did-meri-and-kody-split-sister-wives.html>When Did Meri and Kody Brown Split And Where Do the 'Sister Wives' Stars Stand Now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./when-did-meri-and-kody-split-sister-wives.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
