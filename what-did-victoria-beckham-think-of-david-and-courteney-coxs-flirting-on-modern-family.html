On 4 July 1999, Victoria Adams, former <a href=#>Spice Girls</a> member became Mrs. <a href=#>Victoria Beckham</a> when she married her footballer beau surrounded by their family and friends.To mark the milestone, Victoria posted a picture of the couple with a sweet caption. “They say he isn’t funny, they say I never smile, they said it wouldn’t last,” she wrote. “Today we celebrate 23 years being married. David you are my everything, I love you so much!”.So, was that love really tested when David landed himself a feature in American sitcom Modern Family? Or was it his just his good acting skills that made the chemistry between him and Courteney seem to resonate off-screen.<span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Why These Modern Family Stars Actually Sued To Get Out Of Their Contracts</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-beckham-and-courteney-cox-get-steamy-on-modern-family>David Beckham And Courteney Cox Get Steamy On Modern Family</h2><p>A number of celebrities have popped up in <a href=#>Modern Family</a> for a cameo over the years, but arguably none have been as popular with fans as the latest guest stars - footballing legend David Beckham AND Friends actor Courteney Cox.</p><p>The two appeared in the 10th episode of season 11. Playing themselves, in their scene Beckham and Cox find themselves embroiled in an amusing case of mistaken identity while the Dunphys enjoy a day at Alex's swanky new apartment complex.

From 'The Prescott,' season 11, episode 10 of Modern Family."</p><p>While I'm sure the whole acting lark came as second nature to Cox, Beckham was absolutely buzzing to be on the show, having said in an on-set video: "I'm here in LA on the set of Modern Family, which I'm really excited about.</p><p>"I'm not just a massive fan, but to be here and to be playing a part - that's really incredible, so I'm really excited."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Why These Modern Family Stars Hated The Show And The Wonderful Thing That Happened As A Result">Why These Modern Family Stars Hated The Show And The Wonderful Thing That Happened As A Result</a></span></p><h2 id=victoria-beckham-is-more-of-a-supportive-wife>Victoria Beckham Is More Of A Supportive Wife</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most wives would feel uncomfortable if their significant other were half naked in a steamy hot tub with another woman.

Clad in a bikini, she smiled at the camera while David, in swim shorts, got close to her for the shot.</p><p>David broke the news of his appearance on the hit comedy show by sharing an Instagram snap of himself and the actress reading a script.</p><p>He wrote: "I met a new FRIEND today at work @courteneycoxofficial #modernfamily."</p><p>His wife Victoria gushed over the post, and said: "I can't wait!!!!!!!

The new Modern Family! #DavidDunphy #mitchstolemypose @jessetyler @davidbeckham.”</p><p>Tyler also shared a picture from the visit and joked that he had taken over the role of Victoria while the fashion designer was busy playing Claire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The post: “The role of Claire is being played by @victoriabeckham.
