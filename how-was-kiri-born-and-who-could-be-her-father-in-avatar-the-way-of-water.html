Kiri, it turns out, is actually Grace’s biological daughter. When we meet Kiri, she bares the mark of a hybrid Na’vi with five full fingers, but otherwise, she has blue skin, braided hair at the end of which is her neural queue, and a devotion to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Na’vi’s Great Mother and deity, Eywa</a>.</p><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=103 data-injectable=false>In all respects, Kiri is Na’vi. She is one of The People, but how on Earth (or Pandora) was she born?</p><h2 id=h-how-was-kiri-born-if-dr-grace-augustine-died-in-the-first-avatar data-injectable=false>How was Kiri born if Dr. Grace Augustine died in the first Avatar?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Avatar-The-Way-of-Water-Kiri.jpg><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>The great mystery of Kiri’s birth is addressed pretty early on in the movie when she, Spider (Jack Champion), and Lo’ak (Britain Dalton) visit the Avatar pods at the human operations center. There, we see Grace’s Avatar floating in her tank, connected to machinery that keeps the body from deteriorating.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>The way it’s explained, Grace’s dormant Avatar was discovered to be pregnant shortly after her human body died at the foot of the Tree of Souls. By preserving her body in her Avatar tank, the pregnancy was able to be carried to term, and thus Kiri was able to be born.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>There was no hint that Grace was pregnant in the first Avatar movie, so Kiri’s birth is undoubtedly mysterious, and the nature of her existence is thrown into even more confusion when we discover that she possesses unique abilities and a strong spiritual connection to Eywa that rivals even a tsahìk, a spiritual leader.</p><h2 id=h-how-did-grace-get-pregnant-in-avatar data-injectable=false>How did Grace get pregnant in Avatar?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sigourney-Weaver-as-Dr.-Grace-Augustine-in-Avatar-The-Way-of-Water.jpg><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true>The topic of how Grace got pregnant and to whom is addressed several times throughout the film. When Kiri, Spider, and Lo’ak are in the human operations center, the two boys make fun of the fact that Kiri’s father is probably Norm, the nerdy scientist who was always by Grace’s side in the first movie. Norm stayed on Pandora after the Assault on the Tree of Souls because he proved himself an ally to the Na’vi.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=507 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>Given Grace’s assertive and brazen personality in the first movie, the idea of her and Norm getting it on in between lab tests feels far-fetched. Even more far-fetched is the possibility that Dr. Max Patel, the other civilian scientist who worked alongside Grace, might be Kiri’s father. Although he plays a small but vital role in the first movie and sticks around for the second, we don’t see enough of him or his storyline to merit such a big plot point as being the person who got Grace pregnant.</p><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>What has become the most likely option among theorists is that Kiri might not have a biological father at all and that Grace’s pregnancy could be linked to an unexplainable phenomenon. Given Kiri’s unusual connection to Eywa and her supernatural abilities that allow her to command various nature life on Pandora, it’s highly likely that Kiri’s birth was the result of immaculate conception, thus making her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the child of Eywa</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true>Grace’s last words before she died in Avatar were “I see her,” referring to Eywa. This, combined with everything we’ve come to learn about Kiri just might be what we need to start putting the puzzle pieces together. Furthermore, James Cameron confirmed that the peculiarities in Kiri’s storyline are not meant to be resolved just yet, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Spy.</a> “That’s by design,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>It’s highly likely that Kiri will play a huge role in the survival of Pandora as the Sky People and Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) continue their quest to permanently colonize the planet for the survivors of Earth. If she grows stronger, not only could she tap into the consciousness of the entire planet to do her bidding, but she could also utilize the healing powers Eywa possesses to maybe strike up a treaty with the Sky People and heal Earth of its wounds.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=216 data-injectable=false>We won’t really know what Cameron has planned for Kiri until Avatar 3, tentatively named <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar: The Seed Bearer</a>, releases. For now, Avatar: The Way of Water is currently available to stream on Disney Plus and Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXayutHnKoqmiZZKkv695wKebZq%2BYpHqku9Slm2aalWK1pr6Mn5itoJWneqq6jJqtmqyRp3q1tMRmrpqxXaSzbsPArZyrZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-was-kiri-born-and-who-could-be-her-father-in-avatar-the-way-of-water.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-was-kiri-born-and-who-could-be-her-father-in-avatar-the-way-of-water.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-was-kiri-born-and-who-could-be-her-father-in-avatar-the-way-of-water.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-was-kiri-born-and-who-could-be-her-father-in-avatar-the-way-of-water.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-was-kiri-born-and-who-could-be-her-father-in-avatar-the-way-of-water.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-was-kiri-born-and-who-could-be-her-father-in-avatar-the-way-of-water.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-baby-gronk-the-drip-king.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-baby-gronk-the-drip-king.html>Is Baby Gronk the drip king?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./emma-stone-home-wallpaper.html>Emma Stone's Home Embraces Wallpaper &amp;amp; Lots of Color</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./emma-stone-home-wallpaper.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
