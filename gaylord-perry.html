He was the first pitcher to win 300 games since <a href=#>Early Wynn</a> did it in 1963.</p><p>Won the National League Cy Young award in 1978 at 40 years of age with the San Diego Padres, posting a 21-6 record. Was the oldest ever Cy Young winner until Roger Clemens won it in 2004 at 41.</p><p>During his career with the Cleveland Indians, he was highly outspoken against the hiring of Frank Robinson in 1975 as the major leagues' first African-American manager.

Other variants on the story say that someone else said it about him, but either way, on July 20, 1969, just minutes after the Apollo 11 spacecraft carrying <a href=#>Neil Armstrong</a> and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon, Perry hit the first home run of his career.</p><p>Pitched a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals and <a href=#>Bob Gibson</a> at Candlestick Park in San Francisco on September 17, 1968, beating them 1-0. <a href=#>Ray Washburn</a> of the Cardinals pitched a no-hitter against the Giants at Candlestick the very next day, beating them 2-0 - the only time in baseball history that no-hitters were ever thrown on consecutive days.</p><p>Named to 3 National League All Star Teams (1966, 1970 and 1979) and 2 National League All Star Teams (1972 and 1974).</p><p>Member of 1962 National League Champion San Francisco Giants team. Member of 1971 National League Western Division Champion San Francisco Giants team. Member of 1980 American League Eastern Division Champion New York Yankees team.</p><p>Painted by sports Artist LeRoy Nieman, to commemorate his 300th win.</p><p>Five-time All-Star and two-time Cy Young Award winner Gaylord Perry was a right-handed baseball pitcher who won 314 games in his 22-year-long career, earning him election to the Hall of Fame. Perry became notorious, and quite popular, as an unabashed proponent of the spitball, which had been outlawed by major league baseball back in the 1920s.</p><p>Held the record for most consecutive 15-win season since 1900 with 13 (1966-1978) and was 2nd all-time in career 15-win seasons to baseball immortal Cy Young, who had 15 (1891-1905). <a href=#>Greg Maddux</a> later surpassed both Hall of Famers, notching up 17 in a row (1988-2004).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfnK66uM6rm2aolae%2Fug%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgaylord-perry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgaylord-perry.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgaylord-perry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgaylord-perry.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgaylord-perry.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgaylord-perry.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gina-eckstine.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gina-eckstine.html>Hire Gina Eckstine for a Corporate Event or Performance Booking.</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./140-mm-slim-tower-cpu-cooler-roundup.html>Final Words - The 140mm Slim Tower CPU Cooler Roundup: Thin &amp;amp; Light Done Just Right</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./140-mm-slim-tower-cpu-cooler-roundup.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
