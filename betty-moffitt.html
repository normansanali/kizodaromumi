They raised their two children in their Long Beach, California house until they fully grown up.</p><p>Unfortunately, the pair's marriage ended after 65 years following the death of Bill on <i>16th June 2006</i> at their house in Prescott, Arizona.

Prior to their marriage, they dated for two years after their first meeting at the California State University, Los Angeles in <i>1963</i>.</p><p>Following the nuptial, Billie confessed that she "was totally in love with Larry". However, it was found that she is having a bisexual relationship with King's secretary, <strong>Marilyn Barnett</strong> (born on <i>January 28, 1948</i>) in <i>1968</i>.</p><p>At that time, Marilyn was living rent-free in Billie and Larry King's house based in Malibu. After the affair came out, King asked her to leave the house in <i>1979.</i> But, she refused to leave and threatened to release credit card receipts, household bills and personal letter of Billie and Larry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/7/19/billie-jean-king-husband%20(1)-1626682150700.jpg><p>When things get out of control, Barnett filed a palimony lawsuit of <strong>$2 Million</strong>&nbsp;against Billie in <i>1981. </i>Nevertheless, the court did not fulfill Barnett's lawsuit&nbsp;appeal after finding some evidence of blackmailing and extortion.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, Billie admitted her affair with Barnett was a fling or mistake that will never happen again. She also revealed that she had an abortion of her and King's unborn child in <i>1971</i> without taking any advice or permission of her husband.</p><p>In a bizarre twist of fate, the couple stayed married until Billie did infidelity again with her extra-marital partner, <strong>Ilana Kloss </strong>in <i>1987</i>. Nonetheless, Billie took Kings' son, <strong>Sky</strong> <strong>King</strong> (from Kings' second marriage with <strong>Nancy King</strong>) under her wings as a godmother.</p><p>Following the divorce, Billie re-married her former tennis doubles partner, Ilana<strong> </strong>in a low-key wedding ceremony.
